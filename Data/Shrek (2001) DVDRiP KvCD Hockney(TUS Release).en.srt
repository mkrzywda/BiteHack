1
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,800
"Once upon a time
there was a lovely princess.

2
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,400
"But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort...

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
"which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.

4
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,500
"She was locked away
in a castle...

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,700
"guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,900
"Many brave knights had attempted
to free her from this dreadful prison,

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,600
"but none prevailed

8
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,700
"She waited in
the dragon's keep...

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,600
"in the highest room
of the tallest tower...

10
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,100
for her true love
and true love's first kiss. '

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Like that's ever gonna happen.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,700
- What a load of--

13
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,200
# Somebody once told me
the world is gonna roll me #

14
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,000
# I ain't the sharpest tool
in the shed #

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,900
# She was lookin' kind of dumb
with her finger and her thumb #

16
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,500
# In the shape of an "L"
on her forehead #

17
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,400
# The years start comin'
and they don't stop comin' #

18
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,200
# Fed to the rules
and I hit the ground runnin #

19
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,400
# Didn't make sense
not to live for fun #

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,600
# Your brain gets smart
but your head gets dumb #

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,500
# So much to do
So much to see #

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,100
# So what's wrong with
takin' the backstreets #

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
# You'll never know
if you don't go #

24
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,500
# You'll never shine
if you don't glow #

25
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,400
# Hey, now
You're an all-star #

26

28

glitters is gold #

break the mold #

30
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,700
# It's a cool place
and they say it gets colder #

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
# You're bundled up now
but wait till you get older #

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,100
# But the meteor men
beg to differ #

33
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,000
# Judging by the hole
in the satellite picture. #

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,700
# The ice we skate
is gettin' pretty thin #

35
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,600
# The water's getting warm
so you might as well swim #

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,500
# My world's on fire
How 'bout yours #

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,200
# That's the way I like it
and I'll never get bored #

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
- # Hey, now, you're an all-star #

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,400
- Go!
- Go!

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,500
- Go. Go. Go.

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,100
# Hey, now
You're an all-star #

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,900
- Think it's in there?
- All right. Let's get it!

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,500
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know
what that thing can do to you?

52
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah, it'll grind
your bones for its bread.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Yes, well, actually,
that would be a giant.

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,300
Now, ogres-
They're much worse.

55
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,200
They'll make a suit
from your freshly peeled skin.

56
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,200
- No!
- They'll shave your liver.

57
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,500
Squeeze the jelly
from your eyes!

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,000
- Actually, it's quite good on toast.
- Back! Back beast!

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Back! I warn ya!

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,200
- Right.

61
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,900
This is the part
where you run away.

62
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
And stay out!

63
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,000
"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures. "

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
All right. This one's full.

65
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,100
- Take it away!

66
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,900
- Move it along. Come on! Get up!
- Next!

67
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,800
Give me that!
Your flying days are over.

68
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,400
That's 20 pieces of silver
for the witch. Next!

69
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,000
- Get up! Come on!
- Twenty pieces.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,400
- Sit down there!

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,900
- Keep quiet!

72
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,800
This cage is too small.

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,800
Please don't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
I can change.
Please! Give me another chance!

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,200
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh!
- Next!

76
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,000
- What have you got?
- This little wooden puppet.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm not a puppet.
I'm a real boy.

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,200
Five shillings
for the possessed toy.

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,300
- Take it away.
- Father, please!
Don't let them do this!

80
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
- Help me!
- Next. What have you got?

81
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,800
- Well, I've got a talking donkey.

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,300
Right. Well, that's good for
ten shillings, if you can prove it.

83
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh, go ahead, little fella.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well?

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,700
Oh, oh, he's just--
He's just a little nervous.

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,600
He's really quite a chatterbox.
Talk, you boneheaded dolt--

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,100
- That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
- No, no, he talks!

88
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,200
He does. I can talk.
I love to talk.

89
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm the talkingest
damn thing you ever saw.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,600
- Get her out of my sight.
- No, no!

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,000
I swear! Oh!
He can talk!

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,400
Hey! I can fly!

93
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
- He can talk!
- Ha, ha! That's right, fool!

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,300
Now I'm a flying,
talking donkey.

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,900
You might have seen a housefly,
maybe even a superfly,

97
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,900
but I bet you ain't
never seen a donkey fly.

98
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,800
Ha, ha!

99
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,700
Uh-oh.

100
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,800
Seize him!

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
After him!
He's getting away!

102
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,000
Get him! This way! Turn!

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,300
You there. Ogre!

104
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,600
Aye?

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
By the order of Lord Farquaad,
I am authorized to place
you both under arrest...

106
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,100
and transport you to
a designated... resettlement facility.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, really?
You and what army?

108
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Can I say something to you?

109
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,500
Listen, you was really, really somethin'
back there. Incredible!

110
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,200
Are you talkin' to--
me? Whoa!

111
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes, I was talkin' to you. Can I
tell you that you was great back there?
Those guards!

112
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,600
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

113
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
They was trippin' over themselves
like babes in the woods.

114
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
That really made me
feel good to see that.

115
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,500
- Oh, that's great. Really.
- Man, it's good to be free.

116
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,000
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

117
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,200
But, uh, I don't
have any friends.

118
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,700
And I'm not goin'
out there by myself.

119
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,300
Hey, wait a minute! I got
a great idea! I'll stick with you.

120
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,200
You're a mean,
green, fightin' machine.

121
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,300
Together we'll scare
the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

122
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,200
Oh, wow!
That was really scary.

123
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,800
If you don't mind me sayin',
if that don't work, your breath
certainly will get the job done,

124
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,900
'cause you definitely
need some Tic Tacs or something,
'cause your breath stinks!

125
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,100
You almost burned the hair
outta my nose,

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,800
just like the time-

127
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,500
Then I ate some rotten berries.
I had strong gases eking out
of my butt that day.

128
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,100
Why are you following me?

129
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,700
I'll tell you why.

130
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,600
# 'Cause I'm all alone #

131
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,300
# There's no one here
beside me #

132
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,900
# My problems
have all gone #

133
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,100
# There's no one
to deride me #

134
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
# But you gotta have friends- #

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,100
Stop singing!

136
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
It's no wonder
you don't have any friends.

137
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,700
Wow. Only a true friend
would be that cruelly honest.

138
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,800
Listen, little donkey.
Take a look at me. What am I?

139
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Uh--

140
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,500
- Really tall?
- No! I'm an ogre.

141
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,600
You know.
"Grab your torch and pitchforks."

142
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Doesn't that bother you?

143
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,700
Nope.

144
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,600
- Really?
- Really, really.

145
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,700
- Oh.
- Man, I like you. What's your name?

146
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,300
Uh, Shrek.

147
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,500
Shrek? Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

148
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
You got that kind of
- don't-care-what-nobody-
thinks-of-me thing.

149
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,900
I like that.
I respect that, Shrek. You all right.

150
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want
to live in a place like that?

151
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,300
That would be my home.

152
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,100
Oh! And it is lovely!
Just beautiful.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,800
You are quite a decorator.
It's amazing what you've done
with such a modest budget.

154
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,500
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

155
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,600
I guess you don't
entertain much, do you?

156
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,400
I like my privacy.

157
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,000
You know, I do too.
That's another thing we have in common.

158
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,200
Like, I hate it when
you got somebody in your face.

159
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,100
You're trying to give them
a hint, and they won't leave.
There's that awkward silence.

160
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,600
- Can I stay with you?
- Uh. what?

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Can I stay with you, please?

162
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,500
- Of course!
- Really?

163
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,800
- NO.
- Please! I don't wanna go back there!

164
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,700
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

165
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,300
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

166
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,300
- Please! Please!
- Okay! Okay!

167
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,900
- But one night only.
- Ah! Thank you!

168
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,200
- What are you-- No! No!
- This is gonna be fun!

169
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,100
We can stay up late,
swappin' manly stories,

170
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,900
and in the mornin'
I'm makin' waffles.

171
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,100
- Oh!
- Where do, uh, I sleep?

172
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
Outside!

173
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,900
Oh, well,
I guess that's cool.

174
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, I don't know you,
and you don't know me,

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,400
so I guess outside
is best, you know.

176
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Here I go.

177
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,400
Good night.

178
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,300
I mean, I do like the outdoors.
I'm a donkey. I was born outside.

179
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,900
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside, I guess, you know.

180
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,100
By myself, outside.

181
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,900
# I'm all alone
There's no one here beside me #

182
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,000
I thought I told you to stay outside.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,700
- I am outside.

184
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, gents, it's a far cry from
the farm, but what choice do we have?

185
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,000
It's not home,
but it'll do just fine.

186
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
What a lovely bed.

187
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
- Got ya.
- I found some cheese.

188
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,600
- Ow!
- Blah! Awful stuff.

189
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,900
- Is that you, Gorder?
- How did you know?

190
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,800
Enough!
What are you doing in my house?

191
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,600
Hey!

192
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,200
- Oh, no, no, no.

193
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,800
- Dead broad off the table.
- Where are we supposed to
put her? The bed's taken.

194
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,900
Huh?

195
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,500
What?

196
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,100
I live in a swamp. I put up signs.
I'm a terrifying ogre!

197
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,700
What do I have to do
to get a little privacy?

198
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,100
- Aah!
- Oh. no.

199
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,800
Oh, no.

200
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,400
- No! No!

201
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
- What?

202
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,000
- Quit it.
- Don't push.

203
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,200
What are you doing
in my swamp?

204
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

205
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
- Oh, dear!

206
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,300
Whoa!

207
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,700
All right, get out of here.
All of you, move it!

208
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,100
Come on! Let's go!
Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

209
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,000
- Quickly. Come on!
- No, no!

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
No, no.
Not there. Not there.

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,700
- Oh!

212
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,600
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.

213
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

214
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,200
- What?
- We were forced to come here.

215
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,300
- By who?
- Lord Farquaad.

216
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,100
He huffed und he puffed und he...
signed an eviction notice.

217
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,600
All right.

218
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,900
Who knows where
this Farquaad guy is?

219
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,600
- Oh, I do. I know where he is.

220
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,200
Does anyone else
know where to find him?

221
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,700
- Anyone at all?
- Me! Me!

222
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,600
- Anyone?
- Oh! Oh, pick me!

223
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,100
Oh, I know!
I know! Me, me!

224
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,200
Okay, fine.

225
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,600
Attention,
all fairy tale things.

226
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,200
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially worn out.

227
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,800
In fact, I'm gonna see
this guy Farquaad right now...

228
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,900
and get you all off my land
and back where you came from!

229
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh! You!

230
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,800
You're comin' with me.

231
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,200
All right, that's
what I like to hear, man.

232
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,900
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends,
off on a whirlwind big-city adventure.

233
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
I love it!

234
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,100
- # On the road again #
Sing it with me, Shrek.
- Hey. Oh, oh!

235
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,000
# I can't wait to get
on the road again #

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,900
What did I say
about singing?

237
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,800
- Can I whistle?
- No.

238
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
- Can I hum it?
- All right, hum it.

239
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,100
That's enough.
He's ready to talk.

240
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,800
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can.

241
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,300
You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man!

242
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,900
- You're a monster.
- I'm not the monster here. You are.

243
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,000
You and the rest of that fairy tale
trash, poisoning my perfect world.

244
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,800
Now, tell me!
Where are the others?

245
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,500
- Eat me!

246
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,400
I've tried to be fair
to you creatures.

247
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,800
Now my patience has reached its end!
Tell me or I'll-

248
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,500
No, no, not the buttons.
Not my gumdrop buttons.

249
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
All right then.
Who's hiding them?

250
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,900
Okay, I'll tell you.
Do you know the muffin man?

251
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,100
- The muffin man?
- The muffin man.

252
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,500
Yes, I know the muffin man,
who lives on Drury Lane?

253
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,800
Well, she's married
to the muffin man.

254
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,900
- The muffin man?
- The muffin man!

255
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,900
- She's married to the muffin man.

256
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,500
My lord! We found it.

257
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,700
Then what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

258
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,000
- Oh!

259
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,300
- Magic mirror-
- Don't tell him anything!

260
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,600
No!

261
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,300
- Evening.

262
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,000
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

263
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,500
Is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

264
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,000
Well, technically
you're not a king.

265
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,400
Uh, Thelonius.

266
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,000
- You were saying?
- What I mean is, you're not a king yet.

267
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,500
But you can become one. All
you have to do is marry a princess.

268
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,500
- Go on.

269
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,000
So, just sit back
and relax, my lord,

270
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,200
because it's time for you to
meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

271
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,700
And here they are!

272
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Bachelorette number one
is a mentally abused shut-in
from a kingdom far, faraway.

273
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,700
She likes sushi
and hot tubbing anytime.

274
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,100
Her hobbies include cooking
and cleaning for her two evil sisters.

275
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,500
Please welcome Cinderella.

276
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Bachelorette number two
is a cape-wearing girl
from the land of fancy.

277
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,100
Although she lives with
seven other men, she's not easy.

278
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,600
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips
and find out what a live wire she is.

279
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,300
Come on.
Give it up for Snow White!

280
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,800
And last,
but certainly not least,

281
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,900
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead...

282
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,400
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot boiling lava!

283
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
But don't let that cool you off.

284
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
She's a loaded pistol
who likes pina coladas
and getting caught in the rain.

285
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Yours for the rescuing.
Princess Fiona!

286
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
So will it be
bachelorette number one,

287
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,500
bachelorette number two
or bachelorette number three?

288
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,600
- Two! Two!
- Three! Three!

289
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,900
- Two! Two!
- Three!

290
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,000
Three? One?
Three?

291
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Three!
Pick number three, my lord!

292
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,800
Okay, okay, uh, number three!

293
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,500
Lord Farquaad,
you've chosen Princess Fiona.

294
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,200
# If you like pina coladas #

295
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,400
- # And getting caught in the rain #
- Princess Fiona.

296
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
- # If you're not into yoga # #
- She's perfect.

297
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,300
All I have to do is
just find someone who can go--

298
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,600
But I probably should mention
the little thing that happens at night.

299
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
- I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset--

300
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,500
Silence! I will make
this Princess Fiona my queen,

301
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,600
and DuLoc will finally,
have the perfect king!

302
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,700
Captain, assemble
your finest men.

303
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,500
We're going to have
a tournament.

304
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But that's it. That's it
right there. That's DuLoc.

305
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I told ya I'd find it.

306
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,100
So, that must be
Lord Farquaad's castle.

307
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,100
Uh-huh. That's the place.

308
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,500
Do you think maybe
he's compensating for something?

309
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,400
Hey, wait.
Wait up, Shrek.

310
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,300
Hurry, darling.
We're late. Hurry.

311
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,300
- Hey, you!

312
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,100
Wait a second
Look, I'm not gonna eat ya.

313
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
- I Just-- I just--

314
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,600
It's quiet.

315
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,200
Too quiet.

316
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,700
- Where is everybody?
- Hey, look at this!

317
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,800
# Welcome to DuLoc
such a perfect town #

318
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,200
# Here we have some rules
Let us lay them down #

319
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,000
# Don't make waves, stay in line
and we'll get along fine #

320
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,500
# DuLoc is a perfect place #

321
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,000
# Please keep off of the grass
Shine your shoes, wipe your... face #

322
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,500
# DuLoc is, DuLoc is #

323
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,800
# DuLoc is a perfect #

324
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,200
-# Place # #

325
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,900
Wow! Let's do that again!

326
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,500
No. No.
No, no, no! No.

327
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,000
- Brave knights.

328
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,200
- You are the best and brightest
in all the land

329
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,600
Today one of you
shall prove himself-

330
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,800
All right. You're going the right way
for a smacked bottom.

331
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,700
- Sorry about that.

332
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,300
That champion shall have the honor--
no, no-- the privilege...

333
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,100
to go forth and rescue
the lovely Princess Fiona...

334
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,400
from the fiery keep
of the dragon.

335
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,500
If for any reason
the winner is unsuccessful,

336
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,700
the first runner-up
will take his place...

337
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,400
and so on and so forth.

338
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,800
Some of you may die, but it's
a sacrifice I am willing to make.

339
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,900
Let the tournament begin!

340
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,200
- Oh!

341
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,500
- What is that?

342
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,000
- It's hideous!
- Ah, that's not very nice.

343
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,300
- It's just a donkey.
- Huh?

344
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Indeed. Knights, new plan!

345
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,000
The one who kills the ogre will be
named champion! Have at him!

346
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,800
- Get him!
- Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

347
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,000
Go ahead! Get him!

348
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,600
Can't we just settle this
over a pint?

349
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,900
Kill the beast!

350
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,300
No? All right then.

351
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Come on!

352
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,100
# I don't give a damn
about my reputation #

353
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
-# You're living in the past
It's a new generation #
- Damn!

354
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,800
- # A girl can do
what she wants to do #

355
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,900
# And that's what
I'm gonna do #

356
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,800
# And I don't give a damn
about my bad reputation #

357
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,500
# 0h, no, no, no, no, no
Not me #

358
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,800
-# Me, me, me #
- Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

359
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,500
# And I don't give a damn
about my reputation #

360
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,800
# Never said I wanted
to improve my station. #

361
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,300
Ah!

362
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,300
- # And I'm always feelin' good
when I'm having fun #
- Yeah!

363
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,400
# And I don't have
to please no one #

364
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
The chair!
Give him the chair!

365
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,900
# And I don't give a damn
about my bad reputation #

366
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,000
# 0h, no, no, no, no, no
Not me #

367
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
# Me, me, me #

368
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,100
# 0h, no, no, no, no #

369
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,700
# Not me, not me #

370
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
-# Not me # #

371
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah!

372
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,900
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

373
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,300
I'm here till Thursday.
Try the veal! Ha, ha!

374
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
Shall I give
the order, sir?

375
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,800
No, I have a better idea.

376
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,000
People of DuLoc,
I give you our champion!

377
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,800
- What?
- Congratulations, ogre.

378
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,000
You've won the honor of
embarking on a great and noble quest.

379
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,200
Quest? I'm already on a quest,
a quest to get my swamp back.

380
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,300
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!

381
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,800
Where you dumped
those fairy tale creatures!

382
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,400
- Indeed.

383
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,400
All right, ogre,
I'll make you a deal.

384
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,200
Go on this quest for me, and
I'll give you your swamp back.

385
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,800
Exactly the way it was?

386
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,500
Down to the last
slime-covered toadstool.

387
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,700
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.

388
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,500
What kind of quest?

389
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,000
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna go fight a dragon...

390
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,700
and rescue a princess just so Farquaad
will give you back a swamp...

391
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,800
which you only don't have
because he filled it full of
freaks in the first place.

392
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,000
- Is that about right?
- Maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk.

393
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,400
I don't get it. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

394
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,300
Throttle him,
lay siege to his fortress,

395
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,100
grind his bones to make your bread,
the whole ogre trip.

396
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, I know what.

397
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,200
Maybe I could have
decapitated an entire village...

398
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,300
and put their heads
on a pike,

399
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,000
gotten a knife, cut open their
spleen and drink their fluids.

400
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,100
Does that sound
good to you?

401
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,700
Uh, no, not really, no.

402
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,500
For your information, there's a lot
more to ogres than people think.

403
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,100
- Example?
- Example?

404
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:20,200
- Okay, um, ogres are like onions.
- They stink?

405
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,300
- Yes-- No!
- They make you cry?
- No!

406
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,700
You leave them out in the sun,
they get all brown, start
sproutin' little white hairs.

407
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
No! Layers!

408
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,000
Onions have layers.

409
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,300
Ogres have layers!
Onions have layers.

410
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,600
You get it? We both have layers.

411
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh, you both
have layers. Oh.

412
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,200
You know, not everybody likes onions.

413
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,900
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

414
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I don't care...
what everyone likes.

415
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,400
Ogres are not like cakes.

416
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,400
You know what else
everybody likes? Parfaits.

417
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,300
Have you ever met a person, you
say, "Let's get some parfait, "

418
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,900
they say, "No,
I don't like no parfait"?

419
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
- Parfaits are delicious.
- No!

420
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,700
You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

421
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Ogres are like onions!
End of story.

422
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,700
Bye-bye. See ya later.

423
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

424
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,500
You know, I think
preferred your humming.

425
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,200
Do you have a tissue or something?
I'm making a mess.

426
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,100
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

427
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,100
# I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today #

428
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,500
# Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh #

429
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,900
# I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today #

430
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,200
# Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh #

431
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,100
# And everything
that you receive up yonder #

432
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,000
# Is what you give to me
the day I wander #

433
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,800
# I'm on my way #

434
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,600
# I'm on my way #

435
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,700
# I'm on my way # #

436
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,200
Ooh! Shrek!
Did you do that?

437
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,900
You gotta warn somebody before you
just crack one off. My mouth was open.

438
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,500
Believe me, Donkey, if
it was me, you'd be dead.

439
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,300
It's brimstone.

440
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,300
- We must be getting close.
- Yeah, right, brimstone.

441
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,400
Don't be talking about it's
the brimstone. I know what I
smell. It wasn't no brimstone.

442
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,200
It didn't come off
no stone neither.

443
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,800
Sure, it's big enough,
but look at the location.

444
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,300
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when
you said ogres have layers?

445
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,100
Oh, aye.

446
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,800
Well, I have a bit
of a confession to make.

447
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,100
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear
our fear right out there on our sleeves.

448
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,100
- Wait a second.
Donkeys don't have sleeves.
- You know what I mean.

449
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,700
You can't tell me
you're afraid of heights.

450
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,300
I'm just a little uncomfortable
about being on a rickety bridge
over a boiling lake of lava!

451
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,200
Come on. Donkey.
I'm right here beside ya, okay?

452
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,700
For emotional support,

453
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,300
we'll just tackle this thing
together one little baby step at a time.

454
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
- Really?
- Really, really.

455
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,300
- Okay, that makes me
feel so much better.
- Just keep moving.

456
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,800
- And don't look down.
- Okay, don't look down.
Don't look down.

457
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,100
Don't look down.
Keep on moving. Don't look down.

458
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,900
Shrek! I'm lookin' down!

459
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,700
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off, please!

460
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,200
- But you're already halfway.
- But I know that half is safe!

461
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,900
Okay, fine. I don't
have time for this. You go back.

462
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,300
- Shrek, no! Wait!
- Just, Donkey--

463
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,400
- Let's have a dance then, shall we?
- Don't do that!

464
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,200
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

465
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,200
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that!

466
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,600
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

467
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,900
No, Shrek!

468
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,000
- No! Stop it!
- You said do it! I'm doin' it.

469
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,100
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

470
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,500
Oh!

471
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,500
That'll do, Donkey.
That'll do.

472
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,800
Cool.

473
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,600
So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

474
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,300
Inside, waiting for us
to rescue her.

475
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,200
I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

476
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,800
You afraid?

477
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,100
No, but-- Shh.

478
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh, good. Me neither.

479
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,900
'Cause there's nothin'
wrong with bein' afraid.

480
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,100
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

481
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Unfamiliar dangerous
situation, I might add.

482
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,700
With a dragon that breathes fire
and eats knights and breathes fire,

483
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,200
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward
if you're a little scared.

484
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,000
I sure as heck ain't no coward.
I know that.

485
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,300
Donkey, two things, okay?

486
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,800
Shut... up.

487
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,600
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

488
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,200
Stairs? I thought
we was lookin' for the princess.

489
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,000
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

490
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,500
- What makes you think she'll be there?
- I read it in a book once.

491
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,300
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

492
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,300
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too.

493
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Those stairs won't know
which way they're goin'.

494
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,400
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

495
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,200
Kick it to the curb. Don't mess
with me. I'm the stair master.

496
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,700
I've mastered the stairs.
I wish I had a step right here.
I'd step all over it.

497
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,000
Well, at least we know
where the princess is, but where's the--

498
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,100
Dragon!

499
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,200
Donkey, look out!

500
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
- Got ya!

501
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,600
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

502
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,400
Oh! Aah! Aah!

503
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,900
No. Oh, no. No!

504
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,500
- Oh, what large teeth you have.

505
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,300
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.
I know you probably hear this
all the time from your food,

506
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,400
but you must bleach, 'cause that
is one dazzling smile you got there.

507
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,800
Do I detect a hint
of minty freshness?

508
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,500
And you know what else?
You're - You're a girl dragon!

509
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,900
Oh, sure! I mean,
of course you're a girl dragon.

510
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,600
You're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

511
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,900
What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye?

512
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,700
Ooh. Oh. Oh.

513
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,000
Man, I'd really love to stay,
but, you know, I'm, uh--

514
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,900
I'm an asthmatic, and
I don't know if it'd work out if
you're gonna blow smoke rings.

515
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,800
Shrek!

516
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,500
No! Shrek! Shrek!

517
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,300
Shrek!

518
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,700
Oh! Oh!

519
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,600
- Wake up!
- What?

520
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,300
Are you Princess Fiona?

521
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,700
I am, awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

522
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Oh, that's nice.
Now let's go!

523
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,600
But wait, Sir Knight.

524
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,800
This be-ith our first meeting.

525
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,500
Should it not be
a wonderful, romantic moment?

526
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,700
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
- Hey wait. What are you doing?

527
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,700
You should sweep me
off my feet...

528
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,100
out yonder window and down a rope
onto your valiant steed.

529
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,900
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

530
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,100
Mm-hmm.

531
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,900
But we have to
savor this moment!

532
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,600
You could recite
an epic poem for me.

533
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,000
A ballad? A sonnet!

534
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,300
- A limerick? Or something!
- I don't think so.

535
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,600
Can I at least know
the name of my champion?

536
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,400
Um. Shrek.

537
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,200
Sir Shrek.

538
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,800
I pray that you take this favor
as a token of my gratitude.

539
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Thanks!

540
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,300
You didn't slay the dragon?

541
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,700
- It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

542
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,300
But this isn't right!

543
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,500
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

544
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,600
That's what all
the other knights did.

545
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,900
Yeah right before
they burst into flame.

546
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,400
That's not the point. Oh!

547
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

548
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,900
Well, I have to save my ass.

549
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,100
What kind of knight are you?

550
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,500
One of a kind.

551
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,800
Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.

552
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,000
I believe it's healthy to get to
know someone over a long period of time.

553
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,500
Just call me old-fashioned.

554
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,000
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

555
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm not emotionally ready
for a commitment of, uh, this--

556
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,600
Magnitude really is
the word I'm looking for.

557
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,100
Magnitude-- Hey, that is
unwanted physical contact.

558
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,400
Hey, what are you doing?

559
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,700
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little
and take this one step at a time.

560
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,800
We really should get to know each other
first as friends or pen pals.

561
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,900
I'm on the road a lot,
but I just love receiving cards-

562
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,200
I'd really love
to stay, but-

563
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,800
Don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

564
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,200
You're gonna tear it off.
I don't give permission-- What
are you gonna do with that?

565
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,900
Hey, now. No way.
No! No!

566
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,600
No, no! No.
No, no, no! No! Oh!

567
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
- Hi, Princess!
- It talks!

568
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,900
Yeah, it's getting him
to shut up that's the trick.

569
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,500
Oh!

570
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,800
Okay, you two,
head for the exit!

571
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,400
I'll take care of the dragon.

572
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,000
Run!

573
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,100
You rescued me!
You're amazing. You're--

574
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,900
You're wonderful. You're...

575
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,000
a little unorthodox I'll admit.

576
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,900
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

577
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,600
- I am eternally in your debt.

578
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,800
And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?

579
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,500
I hope you heard that. She called me
a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

580
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,600
The battle is won.

581
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,900
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

582
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,500
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

583
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,700
I have helmet hair.

584
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,900
Please. I would'st look
upon the face of my rescuer.

585
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,500
No, no, you wouldn't-- 'st.

586
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,900
But how will you kiss me?

587
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,600
What? That wasn't
in the job description.

588
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,900
Maybe it's a perk.

589
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,300
No, it's destiny.
Oh, you must know how it goes.

590
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,900
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon...

591
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,900
is rescued by a brave knight,

592
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,100
and then they share
true love's first kiss.

593
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Hmm? With Shrek?
You think-- Wait.

594
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,300
Wait. You think that
Shrek is your true love?

595
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,300
Well, yes.

596
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,500
You think Shrek
is your true love!

597
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,400
What is so funny?

598
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,600
Let's just say I'm
not your type, okay?

599
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,900
Of course, you are.
You're my rescuer.

600
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,400
Now-- Now remove your helmet.

601
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,600
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

602
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

603
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,700
- Take it off.
- No!

604
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,800
- Now!
- Okay!

605
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,400
Easy. As you command,
Your Highness.

606
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,200
You-- You're a-an ogre.

607
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh, you were expecting
Prince Charming.

608
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,400
Well, yes, actually.

609
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,500
Oh, no. This is all wrong.

610
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,700
You're not supposed
to be an ogre.

611
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,900
Princess, I was sent
to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

612
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,700
He's the one
who wants to marry you.

613
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,600
Then why didn't
he come rescue me?

614
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,000
Good question. You should
ask him that when we get there.

615
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,000
But I have to be rescued
by my true love,

616
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,600
not by some ogre
and his-- his pet.

617
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
So much for noble steed.

618
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,300
You're not making
my job any easier.

619
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,600
I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

620
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,900
You can tell Lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

621
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,100
I'll be waiting for him
right here.

622
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy,
all right? I'm a delivery boy.

623
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,100
You wouldn't dare.

624
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
- Put me down!
- Ya comin', Donkey?

625
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
I'm right behind ya.

626
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,700
Put me down, or you will
suffer the consequences!

627
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,100
This is not dignified!
Put me down!

628
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,900
Okay, so here's
another question.

629
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,900
Say there's a woman
that digs you, right, but you
don't really like her that way.

630
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,300
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

631
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,800
but you don't get burned
to a crisp and eaten?

632
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,500
You just tell her
she's not your true love.

633
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,200
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your--

634
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,800
Hey!

635
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,900
The sooner we get
to DuLoc the better.

636
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,900
You're gonna love it there,
Princess. It's beautiful!

637
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,600
And what of my groom-to-be?
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

638
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,700
Let me put it this way,
Princess.

639
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,200
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

640
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,600
I don't know. There are those who
think little of him.

641
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,400
Stop it. Stop it,
both of you.

642
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,300
You're just jealous you can
never measure up to a great
ruler like Lord Farquaad.

643
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah, well, maybe
you're right, Princess.

644
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,300
But I'll let you do the "measuring"
when you see him tomorrow.

645
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,500
Tomorrow?
It'll take that long?

646
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,100
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No, that'll take longer.

647
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,400
- We can keep going.
- But there's robbers in the woods.

648
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,600
Whoa! Timeout, Shrek!
Camping's starting to sound good.

649
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,700
Hey, come on.
I'm scarier than anything we're
going to see in this forest.

650
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,900
I need to find
somewhere to camp now!

651
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,500
- Hey! Over here.
- Shrek, we can do better than that.

652
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,100
I don't think
this is fit for a princess.

653
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,700
No, no, it's perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.

654
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,700
- Homey touches? Like what?

655
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,800
A door? Well, gentlemen,
I bid thee good night.

656
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,100
You want me to read you
a bedtime story? I will.

657
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,400
I said good night!

658
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
Shrek, what are you doing?

659
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,700
I just-- You know-- Oh, come on.

660
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,200
I was just kidding.

661
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,800
And uh that one,
that's Throwback,

662
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,200
the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

663
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,200
Right. Yeah.

664
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,100
Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?

665
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,700
The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories.

666
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,100
Look, there's Bloodnut,
the Flatulent.

667
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,700
- You can guess what he's famous for.
- I know you're making this up.

668
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,300
No, look.
There he is,

669
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,400
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

670
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,900
That ain't nothin' but
a bunch of little dots.

671
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,900
Sometimes things are
more than they appear.

672
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,900
Hmm?

673
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,000
Forget it.

674
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,400
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

675
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,000
Our swamp?

676
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,200
You know, when we're through
rescuing the princess.

677
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,900
We? Donkey, there's no "we."
There's no "our."

678
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,100
There's just me and my swamp.

679
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,300
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a ten-foot wall around my land.

680
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,700
You cut me deep, Shrek.

681
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,000
You cut me real deep just now.

682
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,900
You know what I think?

683
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,000
I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

684
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,100
- No, do ya think?
- Are you hidin' something?

685
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,000
Never mind, Donkey.

686
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,400
Oh, this is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

687
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,900
No, this is one of those drop-it
and leave-it-alone things.

688
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,600
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to?

689
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,300
- Why are you blocking?
- I'm not blocking.

690
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,700
- Oh, yes, you are.
- Donkey, I'm warning you.

691
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,100
- Who you trying to keep out?
- Everyone! Okay?

692
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,600
Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

693
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,900
Oh! For the love of Pete!

694
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,200
What's your problem?
What you got against the whole world?

695
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,400
I'm not the one
with the problem, okay?

696
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,400
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

697
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,200
People take one look at me
and go, "Aah! Help! Run!

698
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,900
A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"

699
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,100
They judge me before
they even know me.

700
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,900
That's why
I'm better off alone.

701
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,600
You know what?

702
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,300
When we met, I didn't think you was
just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

703
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,100
Yeah, I know.

704
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,400
So, uh, are there
any donkeys up there?

705
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,700
Well, there's, um, Gabby,

706
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,000
the Small and Annoying.

707
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,900
Okay, I see it now. The big shiny
one, right there. That one there?

708
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,000
- That's the moon.
- Oh, okay.

709
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,600
Again. Show me again.

710
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,000
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
Show me the princess.

711
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,900
- Hmph.

712
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,600
Ah. Perfect.

713
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,900
Mmm, yeah you know
I like it like that.

714
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,200
- Come on, baby. I said I like it.
- Donkey, wake up.

715
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,700
- Huh? What?
- Wake up.

716
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,600
- What?
- Good morning.

717
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,800
How do you like your eggs?

718
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,800
- Good morning, Princess!
- What's all this about?

719
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,600
We kind of got off
to a bad start yesterday.

720
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,600
I wanted to make it up to you.

721
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,100
After all, you did rescue me.

722
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
- Uh, thanks.

723
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,800
Well, eat up.
We've got a big day ahead of us.

724
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,800
- Shrek!

725
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,700
What? It's a compliment.

726
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,700
Better out than in,
I always say.

727
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,400
- Well, it's no way to behave
in front of a princess.

728
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,000
- Thanks.
- She's as nasty as you are.

729
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,800
You know,
you're not exactly what I expected.

730
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,800
Maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

731
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,500
La liberte! Hey!

732
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Princess!

733
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,100
- What are you doing?

734
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,900
Be still, mon cherie,
for I am your savior!

735
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,400
And I am rescuing you from this green-

736
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,800
- beast.
- Hey!

737
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,100
That's my princess!
Go find your own!

738
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:58,100
Please, monster!
Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

739
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,600
Look, pal, I don't know
who you think you are!

740
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,200
Oh! Of course!
Oh, how rude.

741
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,300
Please let me
introduce myself.

742
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,100
Oh, Merry Men!

743
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,900
# Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo #

744
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,000
# I steal from the rich
and give to the needy #

745
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,100
- # He takes a wee percentage #
-# But I'm not greedy #

746
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,100
# I rescue pretty damsels
Man, I'm good #

747
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
- # What a guy, Monsieur Hood #
- Break it down.

748
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,800
# I like an honest fight
and a saucy little maid #

749
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,000
# What he's basically saying
is he likes to get-- #
- # Paid #

750
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,600
- # So #
- # When an ogre in the bush
grabs a lady by the tush #

751
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,900
-# That's bad #
-# That's bad #

752
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,100
# When a beauty's with a beast
it makes me awfully mad #

753
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,000
# He's mad
He's really, really mad #

754
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,900
# I'll take my blade and
ram it through your heart #

755
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,400
# Keep your eyes on me, boys
'cause I'm about to start # #

756
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,200
Man, that was annoying!

757
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh, you little--

758
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,100
Um, shall we?

759
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,200
- Hold the phone.

760
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,600
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now.

761
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,400
- Where did that come from?
- What?

762
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,400
That! Back there.
That was amazing!

763
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,200
Where did you learn that?

764
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,300
Well--
When one lives alone,

765
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,100
uh, one has to learn these things
in case there's a--

766
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,700
- There's an arrow in your butt!
- What?

767
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,400
- Oh, would you look at that?
- Oh, no. This is all my fault.

768
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,200
- I m so sorry.
- Why? What's wrong?

769
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,600
- Shrek's hurt.
- Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt?
Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

770
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,300
- Donkey, I'm okay.
- You can't do this to me.
I'm too young for you to die.

771
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,400
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head and cough.

772
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,400
- Does anyone know the Heimlich?
- Donkey! Calm down.

773
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,000
If you want to help Shrek,
run into the woods and find me
a blue flower with red thorns.

774
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,400
Blue flower, red thorns. Okay,
I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns.

775
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,900
Don't die, Shrek. If you see
a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

776
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,900
- Donkey!
- Oh, yeah. Right.
Blue flower, red thorns.

777
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,200
- Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?

778
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,400
- For getting rid of Donkey.
- Ah.

779
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,800
Now you hold still,
and I'll yank this thing out.

780
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,900
Ow! Hey!
Easy with the yankin'.

781
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,600
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
- No, it's tender.

782
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,300
Now, hold on.

783
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,400
- What you're doing
is the opposite of help.
- Don't move.

784
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,000
- Look, timeout.
- Would you--

785
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,500
Okay. What do you propose we do?

786
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,100
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

787
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,400
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't color-blind!

788
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,500
- Blue flower, red thorns.
- Ow!

789
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,800
Hold on, Shrek!
I'm comin'!

790
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,400
Ow! Not good.

791
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,900
- Okay. Okay, I can nearly see the head.

792
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,500
- It's just about-
- Ow! Ohh!

793
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,800
Ahem.

794
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,200
Nothing happened.
We were just, uh-

795
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,800
Look, if you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask.

796
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,000
Oh, come on!
That's the last thing on my mind.

797
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,700
The princess here
was just-- Ugh!

798
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,200
- Ow!
- Hey, what's that?

799
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,100
That's-- Is that blood?

800
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,200
# My beloved monster and me #

801
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,800
# We go everywhere together #

802
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,400
# Wearin'a raincoat
that has four sleeves #

803
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,900
- # Gets us through all kinds
of weather #
- Aah!

804
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,100
# She will always be
the only thing #

805
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,400
# That comes between me
and the awful sting #

806
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:15,400
# That comes from living in a world
that's so damn mean #

807
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:28,200
# Oh oh-oh-oh-oh #

808
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,900
Hey!

809
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,000
- # La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la #

810
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,900
# La-la, la-la, la-la # #

811
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,700
There it is, Princess.

812
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,000
Your future awaits you.

813
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,200
- That's DuLoc?
- Yeah, I know.

814
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,900
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

815
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,300
which I think means
he has a really- Ow!

816
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,300
Um, I, uh-

817
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,700
- I guess we better move on.
- Sure.

818
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,700
But, Shrek?

819
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,500
- I'm- I'm worried about Donkey.

820
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,900
- What?
- I mean, look at him.

821
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,800
- He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

822
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:24,700
That's what they always say,
and then next thing you know,
you're on your back.

823
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,100
- Dead.
- You know, she's right.

824
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,000
You look awful.
Do you want to sit down?

825
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,700
- I'll make you some tea.
- I didn't want to say nothin',

826
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,400
but I got this twinge in my neck,
and when I turn my head like this, look.

827
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,800
- Ow! See?

828
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,800
- Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.

829
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,300
Hey, where you goin'?
Oh, man, I can't feel my toes!

830
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,800
I don't have any toes!

831
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,000
I think I need a hug.

832
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,700
Mmm.

833
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,600
Mmm. This is good.
This is really good.

834
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,800
- What is this?
- Uh, weedrat.

835
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,800
Rotisserie style.

836
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,400
No kidding.

837
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,300
Well, this is delicious.

838
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,300
Well, they're also great
in stews.

839
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,600
Now, I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean weedrat stew.

840
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,100
I guess I'll be dining
a little differently tomorrow night.

841
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,100
Maybe you can
come visit me in the swamp sometime.

842
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,100
II cook all kinds
of stuff for you.

843
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,000
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare-
you name it.

844
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,100
I'd like that.

845
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,900
# See the pyramids
along the Nile #

846
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,300
Um, Princess?

847
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,600
- # Watch the sunrise
from a tropic isle #
- Yes, Shrek?

848
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,300
- I, um, I was wondering.
- # Just remember, darling
all the while #

849
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,600
Are you--

850
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,100
# You belong to me # #

851
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,900
Are you gonna eat that?

852
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,400
- Man, isn't this romantic?
Just look at that sunset.
- Sunset?

853
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,800
Oh, no!
I mean, it's late.

854
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,700
- I- It's very late.
- What?

855
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,600
Wait a minute.
I see what's goin' on here.

856
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,500
- You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
- Yes!

857
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.
You know, I'd better go inside.

858
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,700
Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to
be afraid of the dark, too, until--

859
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,500
Hey, no, wait,
I'm still afraid of the dark.

860
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,500
- Good night.

861
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,500
Good night.

862
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,500
- Ohh!

863
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,300
Now I really see
what's goin'on here.

864
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,100
Oh, what are you
talkin' about?

865
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,000
I don't even wanna hear it. Look,
I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

866
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,300
I know you two were diggin'
on each other. I could feel it.

867
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,000
You're crazy,
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

868
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,400
Oh, come on, Shrek.
Wake up and smell the pheromones.

869
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,000
- Just go on in
and tell her how you feel.
- I--

870
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
There's nothing to tell.
Besides, even if I did tell her that,

871
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,800
well, you know--

872
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,300
and I'm not sayin' I do
'cause I don't--

873
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,700
she's a princess,
and I'm-

874
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,400
An ogre?

875
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,900
Yeah. An ogre.

876
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,900
- Hey, where you goin'?
- To get... more firewood.

877
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,000
Princess?

878
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,700
Princess Fiona?

879
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,500
Princess, where are you?

880
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,900
Princess?

881
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,500
It's very spooky in here.
I ain't playing no games.

882
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,600
- Aah!
- Oh, no!
- No, help!

883
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,700
- Shh!
- Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

884
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,600
- What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, I'm the princess.

885
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,300
- Aab!
- It's me, in this body.

886
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,800
Oh, my God!
You ate the princess!

887
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,600
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!

888
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,000
- Listen, keep breathing!
I'll get you out of there!
- No!

889
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,400
- Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
- Shh.

890
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,300
- Shrek!
- This is me.

891
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,000
Princess?

892
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,400
What happened to you?
You're, uh, uh,

893
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,300
uh, different.

894
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,500
- I'm ugly, okay?
- Well, yeah!

895
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,600
Was it something you ate? 'Cause
I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

896
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,100
- You are what you eat, I said. Now-
- No.

897
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,500
I-- I've been this way
as long as I can remember.

898
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,800
What do you mean? Look,
I ain't never seen you like this before.

899
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,000
It only happens
when the sun goes down.

900
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,900
"By night one way,
by day another.

901
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,900
"This shall be the norm...

902
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,900
"until you find
true love's first kiss...

903
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,400
and then
take love's true form."

904
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,800
Ah, that's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

905
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,600
It's a spell.

906
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,300
When I was a little girl,

907
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,900
a witch cast a spell
on me.

908
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,300
Every night I become this.

909
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,000
This horrible, ugly beast!

910
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:46,400
I was placed in a tower to await the day
my true love would rescue me.

911
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,800
That's why I have to marry
Lord Farquaad tomorrow...

912
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,200
before the sun sets
and he sees me...

913
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,300
like this.

914
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,400
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad.

915
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,500
You're not that ugly.
Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

916
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,400
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24-7.

917
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,800
But, Donkey,
I'm a princess,

918
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,400
and this is not how a princess
is meant to look.

919
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,000
Princess, how 'bout if you
don't marry Farquaad?

920
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,900
I have to.

921
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,700
Only my true love's kiss
can break the spell.

922
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,200
But, you know, um,
you're kind of an ogre,

923
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,600
and Shrek- well,
you got a lot in common.

924
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,000
Shrek?

925
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,800
Princess, I-
Uh, how's it going, first of all?

926
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,500
Good?
Um, good for me too.

927
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,400
I'm okay.

928
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,300
I saw this flower and thought of you
because it's pretty and--

929
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,400
well, I don't really like it,
but I thought you might like it
'cause you're pretty.

930
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,600
But I like you anyway.
I'd-uh, uh-

931
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,000
I'm in trouble.
Okay, here we go.

932
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,500
I can't just marry whoever I want.

933
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,800
Take a good look
at me, Donkey.

934
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,700
I mean, really,

935
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,300
who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

936
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,700
"Princess" and "ugly"
don't go together.

937
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,100
- That's why I can't
stay here with Shrek.

938
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,500
My only chance to live happily
ever after is to marry my true love.

939
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,800
- Don't you see, Donkey?

940
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,000
That's just how
it has to be.

941
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's the only way
to break the spell.

942
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,800
- You at least gotta
tell Shrek the truth.
- No!

943
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,700
You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

944
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,700
What's the point of being able to talk
if you gotta keep secrets?

945
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,900
Promise you won't tell.
Promise!

946
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,900
All right, all right.
I won't tell him. But you should.

947
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,900
I just know before this is over,
I'm gonna need a whole lot
of serious therapy.

948
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,400
- Look at my eye twitchin'.

949
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,700
I tell him, I tell him not.

950
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:14,000
I tell him,
I tell him not.

951
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,800
I tell him.

952
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,000
Shrek!

953
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,500
Shrek, there's something
I want--

954
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,500
Shrek.

955
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,900
- Are you all right?
- Perfect!

956
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,900
Never been better.

957
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,100
I-I don't-
There's something I have to tell you.

958
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,600
You don't have to tell me
anything, Princess.

959
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,600
- I heard enough last night.
- You heard what I said?

960
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,600
Every word.

961
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,800
I thought you'd understand.

962
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,700
Oh, I understand.

963
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,200
Like you said, "Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?"

964
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,900
But I thought that
wouldn't matter to you.

965
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,600
Yeah? Well, it does.

966
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,300
- Ah, right on time.

967
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,100
Princess, I've brought you
a little something.

968
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,900
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

969
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,400
Who said that?
Couldn't have been a donkey.

970
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,000
Princess Fiona.

971
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,700
As promised.
Now hand it over.

972
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:38,000
Very well, ogre. The deed
to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed

973
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:42,500
Take it and go
before I change my mind.

974
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,200
Forgive me, Princess,
for startling you,

975
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,000
but you startled me,

976
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,800
for I have never seen
such a radiant beauty before.

977
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,600
I am Lord Farquaad.

978
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,500
Lord Farquaad?
Oh, no, no.

979
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,300
- Forgive me, my lord,
for I was just saying...

980
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:05,800
a short...farewell.

981
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:10,300
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

982
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,100
It's not like
it has feelings.

983
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:16,000
No, you're right.
It doesn't.

984
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,900
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair,
flawless Fiona.

985
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,900
- I ask your hand in marriage.

986
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,900
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

987
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:36,000
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make--

988
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:39,100
Excellent! I'll start the plans,
for tomorrow we wed!

989
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,900
No! I mean, uh,

990
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,300
why wait?

991
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,200
Let's get married today
before the sun sets.

992
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,800
Oh, anxious, are we?
You're right.

993
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,700
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

994
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,900
There's the caterer,
the cake, the band, the guest list.

995
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,900
Captain, round up
some guests!

996
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,600
Fare-thee-well, ogre.

997
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,200
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

998
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,800
- Yeah? So what?
- Shrek, there's something
about her you don't know.

999
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,100
Look, I talked to her
last night. She's--

1000
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:13,100
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

1001
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,900
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

1002
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,700
Shrek, I-
I wanna go with you.

1003
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,700
I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me.

1004
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:25,600
I live alone!
My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

1005
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,600
Understand? Nobody!

1006
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:32,400
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

1007
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,500
- Yeah. You know what?

1008
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,700
You thought wrong!

1009
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,200
Shrek.

1010
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,600
# I heard there was
a secret chord #

1011
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,700
# That David played
and it pleased the Lord #

1012
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:58,400
# But you don't really
care for music, do ya #

1013
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,300
# It goes like this
the fourth, the fifth #

1014
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,700
# The minor fall
the major lift #

1015
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:12,300
# The baffled king
composing hallelujah #

1016
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,300
# Hallelujah #

1017
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,800
# Hallelujah #

1018
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:22,700
# Hallelujah #

1019
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:27,300
# Hallelujah #

1020
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,500
# Baby, I've been here before #

1021
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,500
# I know this room
I've walked this floor #

1022
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,500
# I used to live alone
before I knew you #

1023
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,100
# I've seen your flag
on the marble arch #

1024
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,300
# But love is not
a victory march #

1025
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:52,700
# It's a cold
and it's a broken hallelujah #

1026
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,300
# Hallelujah #

1027
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,300
# Hallelujah #

1028
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,400
# Hallelujah #

1029
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:08,800
# Hallelujah #

1030
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:14,100
# And all I ever
learned from love #

1031
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,400
# Is how to shoot at someone #

1032
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,900
- # Who outdrew you #

1033
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:22,600
# And it's not a cry
you can hear at night #

1034
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,500
# It's not somebody
who's seen the light #

1035
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:32,600
- # It's a cold
and it's a broken hallelujah #

1036
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,200
# Hallelujah #

1037
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,400
# Hallelujah #

1038
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,700
# Hallelujah #

1039
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:48,100
# Hallelujah # #

1040
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,800
Donkey?

1041
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,000
- What are you doing?

1042
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I would think, of all people, you would
recognize a wall when you see one.

1043
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,900
Well, yeah.

1044
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,200
But the wall's supposed
to go around my swamp, not through it.

1045
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,000
It is around your half. See,
that's your half, and this is my half.

1046
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,600
Oh! Your half. Hmm.

1047
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,100
Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.

1048
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,200
I did half the work,
I get half the booty.

1049
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,600
Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.

1050
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,900
- Back off!
- No, you back off.

1051
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,800
- This is my swamp!
- Our swamp.

1052
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,800
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go.

1053
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,700
- Stubborn jackass!
- Smelly ogre.

1054
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,000
Fine!

1055
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,300
- Hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you yet.
- Well, I'm through with you.

1056
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,400
Uh-uh. You know,
with you it's always, "Me, me, me!"

1057
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, guess what!
Now it's my turn!

1058
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,200
So you just shut up
and pay attention!

1059
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,100
You are mean to me.

1060
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,500
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

1061
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,600
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.

1062
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,500
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you
so bad, how come you came back?

1063
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,600
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

1064
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,700
Oh, yeah.
You're right, Donkey.

1065
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,800
I forgive you...
for stabbin' me in the back!

1066
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:10,200
Ohh! You're so wrapped up
in layers, onion boy, you're
afraid of your own feelings.

1067
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,500
- Go away'
- There you are, doing it again
just like you did to Fiona.

1068
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,000
All she ever do was like you,
maybe even love you.

1069
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,200
Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.

1070
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I heard the two of you
talking.

1071
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,900
She wasn't talkin' about you.

1072
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,200
She was talkin' about, uh,
somebody else.

1073
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,000
She wasn't talking
about me?

1074
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,200
Well, then who was
she talking about?

1075
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,900
Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me.

1076
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,200
- Right? Right?
- Donkey!

1077
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,700
- No!
- Okay, look.

1078
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,600
I'm sorry, all right?

1079
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,100
Hmph.

1080
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,800
I'm sorry.

1081
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,100
I guess I am just a big,
stupid, ugly ogre.

1082
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,000
Can you forgive me?

1083
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Hey, that's what friends
are for, right?

1084
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,600
Right. Friends?

1085
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,500
Friends.

1086
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,500
So, um,

1087
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,700
what did Fiona
say about me?

1088
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,900
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her?

1089
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,800
The wedding!
We'll never make it in time.

1090
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,900
Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where
there's a will, there's a way,

1091
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,000
and I have a way.

1092
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,500
- Donkey?

1093
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,900
I guess it's just
my animal magnetism.

1094
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:35,100
Aw, come here, you.

1095
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,900
All right, all right. Don't get
all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass.

1096
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,400
All right, hop on
and hold on tight.

1097
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,900
I haven't had a chance to
install the seat belts yet.

1098
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,400
Whoo!

1099
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,600
People of DuLoc,

1100
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,200
we gather here today...

1101
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,200
to bear witness...

1102
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,100
- to the union...
- Um-

1103
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,600
- of our new king-
- Excuse me.

1104
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,200
- Could we just skip ahead
to the "I do's"?

1105
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,100
Go on.

1106
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,500
Go ahead, have some fun. If we
need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

1107
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,900
Shrek, wait, wait!
Wait a minute!

1108
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,600
- You wanna do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

1109
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,500
There's a line you
gotta wait for.

1110
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,900
The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now
or forever hold your peace."

1111
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,600
- That's when you say, "I object!"
- I don't have time for this!

1112
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,200
Wait. What are you doing?
Listen to me!

1113
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,300
- Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.

1114
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,500
- You wanna hold her?
- Yes.

1115
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,200
- Please her?
- Yes!

1116
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,300
# Then you got to, got to
try a little tenderness # #

1117
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,000
- The chicks love that romantic crap!
- All right! Cut it out.

1118
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,700
- When does this guy say the line?
- We gotta check it out.

1119
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,700
- And so, by the power vested in me,

1120
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,000
- What do you see?
- The whole town's in there.

1121
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,100
- I now pronounce you husband and wife,
- They're at the altar.

1122
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,500
- king and queen.
- Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

1123
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,100
- Oh, for the love of Pete!

1124
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,300
I object!

1125
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,400
- Shrek?

1126
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,300
Oh, now what
does he want?

1127
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,700
Hi, everyone.
Havin' a good time, are ya?

1128
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,800
I love DuLoc,
first of all.

1129
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,300
- Very clean.
- What are you doing here?

1130
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,200
Really, it's rude enough
being alive when no one wants you,

1131
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,500
- but showing up uninvited to a wedding-
- Fiona!

1132
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,500
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?

1133
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,300
It's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me--

1134
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,700
- But you can't marry him.
- And why not?

1135
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,600
Because-- Because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

1136
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,900
Outrageous!
Fiona, don't listen to him.

1137
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,600
- He's not your true love.
- And what do you know about true love?

1138
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,800
Well, I-- Uh-

1139
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,100
- I mean--
- Oh, this is precious.

1140
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:16,800
The ogre
has fallen in love with the princess!

1141
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,000
- Oh, good Lord

1142
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,900
An ogre and a princess!

1143
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,700
Shrek,
is this true?

1144
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,400
Who cares?
It's preposterous!

1145
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,000
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away
from our "happily ever after."

1146
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,500
Now kiss me!
Mmmm!

1147
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,700
"By night one way,
by day another."

1148
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,100
I wanted to show you before.

1149
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,200
Well, uh,

1150
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,200
that explains a lot.

1151
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,900
Ugh! It's disgusting!

1152
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,900
Guards! Guards!

1153
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:25,100
I order you to get that
out of my sight now! Get them!

1154
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,800
- Get them both!
- No, no!

1155
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:31,500
This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
This marriage is binding,
and that makes me king!

1156
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,700
- See? See?
- No, let go of me! Shrek!

1157
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,400
- No!
- Don't just
stand there, you morons.

1158
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,000
Get out of my way!
Fiona!

1159
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,000
Arrgh!

1160
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,900
I'll make you regret the day we met.
I'll see you drawn and quartered!

1161
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,700
- You'll beg for death to save you!
- No! Shrek!

1162
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,200
- And as for you, my wife,
- Fiona!

1163
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,900
II have you locked back in that tower
for the rest of your days!

1164
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,700
- I am king!

1165
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,500
I will have order!
I will have perfection! I will have--

1166
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,600
Aaah!

1167
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,200
- Aah!
- All right. Nobody move.

1168
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,300
I got a dragon here,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

1169
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,900
- I'm a donkey on the edge!

1170
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,700
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?

1171
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,600
Go ahead, Shrek.

1172
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,100
Uh, Fiona?

1173
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,400
Yes, Shrek?

1174
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:33,300
I-- I love you.

1175
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,500
Really?

1176
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,500
Really, really.

1177
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,400
I love you too.

1178
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,200
Aawww!

1179
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:53,200
"Until you
find true love's first kiss...

1180
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,400
and then take love's true form."

1181
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,800
"Take love's
true form. Take love's true form."

1182
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,100
Fiona?

1183
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,000
Fiona.

1184
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,500
Are you all right?

1185
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,500
Well, yes.

1186
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,700
But I don't understand.

1187
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,800
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1188
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,600
But you are beautiful.

1189
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,300
I was hoping this would be
a happy ending.

1190
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:02,300
# I thought love was only true
in fairy tales #

1191
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,600
Oy!

1192
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,300
# Meant for someone else
but not for me #

1193
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,500
# Love was out to get me #

1194
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,300
# That's the way it seemed #

1195
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:19,700
# Disappointment
haunted all my dreams #

1196
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,900
# And then I saw her face #

1197
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,600
# Now I'm a believer #

1198
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,100
# And not a trace #

1199
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,900
# Of doubt in my mind #

1200
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,900
- # I'm in love #
- # Ooh-ahh #

1201
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,200
# I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her #

1202
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,400
# If I tried #

1203
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,500
God bless us, everyone.

1204
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,900
Come on, y 'all'
# Then I saw her face # Ha-ha!

1205
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:50,000
# Now I'm a believer #
Listen!

1206
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,700
# Not a trace #

1207
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,500
# Of doubt in my mind #

1208
