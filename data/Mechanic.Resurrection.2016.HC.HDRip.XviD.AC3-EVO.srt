00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Play one of the best new FPS shooters,
search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK

2
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:43,090
Sr. Santos, so good to see you.

3
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,780
We saved you usual table Mr Santos

4
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,110
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

5
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:13,726
5 Months in Brazil.
You're a hard man to find.

6
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,990
You even have the accent right.

7
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:25,110
I do say so.

8
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,950
The principal I represent has an offer for you.

9
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,866
He would like three men killed.
Each death must look like an accident.

10
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,728
Your specialty, I believe.

11
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:41,697
Seems that reports of your demise
have been greatly exaggerated.

12
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:47,158
My principal can make that known
to certain interested parties.

13
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:52,442
Which means that your new life here
would end rather quickly.

14
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:56,932
Or you can do the job
and go back to being dead.

15
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:00,648
What's your pleasure 'Senor Otto Santos'?

16
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:06,132
Let me make a call.

17
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,123
What are you doing?

18
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,629
Tell your principal,
never pays to fuck with the dead!!

19
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,328
Get the fuck on the ground!!

20
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:21,057
Get the fuck down!!
Don't look at me!!

21
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:33,942
- Bishop.
- Hello, Mei.

22
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,958
You're different.

23
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,100
Older.

24
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,381
Hmmmmm, something more than that.

25
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:43,991
I need time to find someone
before they find me.

26
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:46,783
Then I'll be moving on.

27
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,705
Who else is here?

28
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:49,297
No one.

29
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,050
Diving season's over. Come.

30
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,648
Your home is waiting for you.

31
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:57,830
- How was your trip?
- It was okay.

32
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,874
It was a busy season.

33
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:07,174
But don't worry,
no one came near your home.

34
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,759
-Nothing's changed.
-Get some rest.

35
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:52,904
Hi, how can I help you?

36
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:54,167
Oh, great you speak English.

37
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:58,437
Um…I'm running low on first aid.
I'm staying on the boat.

38
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,378
Sure.

39
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:05,606
This is all I have.

40
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,356
Thanks.

41
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:17,061
If I don't have what you need,
I can call our supply boat.

42
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:19,556
They can take you back to Phuket to get it.

43
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:22,527
No, this is great.

44
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:23,673
Thanks so much.

45
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,664
Any time.

46
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:46,761
Bishop!

47
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,791
Bishop!

48
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,470
They're fighting. It's bad.

49
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:10,701
I've met her. She has a backbone.

50
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:14,501
Women like that get killed in these situations.

51
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:18,517
Domestic squabble, Mei.
Not my business.

52
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:25,045
You helped me once.
Help her!

53
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,857
Or I will do it.

54
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,435
Hold this.

55
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,434
Frank, get the fuck away from me!!

56
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,434
Frank!!

57
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:14,865
Not worth it.

58
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,309
Bitch.

59
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,465
- Let her go.
- Who the fuck are you?

60
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,851
Please help me.

61
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:31,463
I said let her go.
Last chance.

62
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:33,242
Let go of me Frank.

63
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,977
You don't wanna do that.

64
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,514
Fuck you!!

65
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:51,942
Is he dead?

66
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:00,418
Bishop?

67
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:05,633
Oh, shit!

68
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:12,693
Take her ashore.
I'll deal with the boat.

69
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:13,620
Okay.

70
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:25,483
- Bishop.
- Where is she?

71
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,614
Sleeping. In your bungalow.

72
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:37,643
What's going on?

73
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:40,544
Gina Thorn. American.

74
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,810
- That's you, right?
- Yeah.

75
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:45,485
You're the second woman who
has my picture in her phone.

76
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:49,835
The first was working for a guy called Crain.
Name ring a bell?

77
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:53,443
The only thing you got right was my name.

78
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:57,661
The first woman was a messenger.
Is that what you are?

79
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:00,181
So what's the message?

80
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:03,180
- I already told you...
- Tell me about Craine!

81
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,405
What are you supposed to do for him?
Where is he?

82
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,720
Fine. I'll talk!

83
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:25,315
Look, I don't work for Crain.
That's the truth! But he did send me.

84
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,006
Where is he?

85
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:29,587
- I don't know
- Why are you here?

86
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:32,743
He has something on me.

87
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:35,886
- I had no choice.
- Right.

88
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,241
- Any of his men nearby?
- He didn't say, I didn't ask.

89
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,702
What about Frank?

90
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,422
- Part of the setup.
- Explain.

91
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:48,028
He was supposed to get mean.
I'd escape to this island.

92
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:52,600
It wasn't meant to be real.
But then Frank got drunk and attacked me.

93
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,133
Crain wanted me to look like a victim.

94
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:58,544
- And get next to me?
- Yeah.

95
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:03,268
But Frank took his part too far...
So we meet. What's next?

96
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,731
I use that cell. And called the
preprogrammed number. Let it ring once.

97
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,061
After that, I don't know.

98
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:12,947
My 'new girl' gets kidnapped is what.

99
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:16,076
- What?
- The thought didn't cross your mind?

100
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,297
Okay so you fall for me and
Crain thinks he has leverage on you. Why?

101
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:27,865
Well to force me to do something I don't want to do.

102
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:30,344
What is it that you do?

103
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:34,045
I'll make the call not you.
I'll choose when they come.

104
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:35,046
Then I'll take Crain out.

105
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:39,234
No I'm not going to help you kill anyone!

106
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:44,546
Do you really believe that Crain lets
people he blackmails into helping him live?

107
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,073
I've spent my whole life setting people up to die.

108
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:52,313
I can set you up to live.

109
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:04,430
Subtitled created by Freaky.

110
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,063
My father was a doctor of Eastern medicine.

111
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:23,343
He was a healer.
Bishop used to study with him.

112
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:25,363
To learn how to heal?

113
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:27,395
Men like him?

114
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:33,521
I thought so too,
but my father understood...

115
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:39,794
that those who have been hurt the most
often have the greatest ability to heal.

116
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:39,837
18 months ago special military operative
Gina Thorn left a warzone in Afghanistan...

117
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:42,948
to offer humanitarian assistance in Cambodia.

118
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,227
After my last deployment I just needed a change.

119
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,655
Too many innocent people have
been caught in the line of fire.

120
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:52,370
Rules of engagement made it impossible to prevent.

121
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:57,610
And then, you know when I came to Phnom Penh, I uh…

122
00:19:57,727 --> 00:20:02,671
I don't know it just felt right here.

123
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:07,981
And, felt like I can maybe do
something good with my life.

124
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:29,261
I can't afford surprises.
Need to know what Crain has on you.

125
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:39,107
I run a shelter for victims of trafficking in Cambodia.

126
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:43,497
There's always been an issue or two, but…
I've managed to handle it.

127
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:50,477
A few weeks ago,
one of my staff members was kidnapped.

128
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:55,638
Two days later, she was thrown off
a truck at my front door.

129
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:59,860
Beaten. Died within an hour.

130
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:04,261
Crain sent this asshole Jeremy...

131
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:08,697
who said that was just a taste
of what he would do to everyone at the shelter…

132
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:11,099
including children.

133
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:17,069
They are my weakness.
All the leverage Crain needed.

134
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:21,478
So you see I didn't have a choice.

135
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:25,171
I had to do what Crain wanted me to.

136
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,336
- What are you doing?
- Hold my hand.

137
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:41,337
It's for Crain's people.

138
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,096
They're watching.

139
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:45,893
Where?

140
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:48,357
Two men in a Zodiac.

141
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,402
Out in the ocean.

142
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,403
Subtitled created by Freaky.

143
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:05,118
There you are. Come on you two.
You're gonna miss the best part.

144
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,064
Give me your hands.

145
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:14,916
Hold this please.

146
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:15,946
We can just get a drink and…

147
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:19,483
No you will not. You will stay right there…
Thank you very much.

148
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:20,727
What are you doing?

149
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,876
All couples have to be tied together.

150
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:25,594
But we're not a couple.

151
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,537
You sure looked like it on the beach.

152
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:39,203
So um…do you go to weddings a lot?

153
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,431
Not my idea of a good time.

154
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:45,671
Me neither.

155
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:47,383
Here.

156
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:49,958
We supposed to drink this?

157
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:56,720
No. Put your fingertips in it and place 3 dots on
each others forehead for good luck.

158
00:23:57,128 --> 00:23:59,239
- Enjoy.
- I could use some luck.

159
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,518
Enjoy?

160
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:13,445
Okay, my turn.

161
00:24:13,448 --> 00:24:15,220
Come on lets just get a drink.
Leave that.

162
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,396
All right one second.

163
00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:23,365
This is a great look for you.

164
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:38,226
You missed a spot.

165
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:44,332
It's kind of stuck.

166
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,468
Okay, okay.

167
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:49,595
Next time you use your shoe.

168
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,315
I love this song.

169
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:03,299
This is a Thai song?

170
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:04,364
Yeah.

171
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:06,262
It's so good.

172
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,575
Wanna dance?

173
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:19,735
No don't worry.
I don't want to dance with you.

174
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:21,623
What do you think I'm a bad dancer?

175
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:24,456
You look like you're a terrible dancer.

176
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,804
Hey.

177
00:25:54,965 --> 00:26:01,281
I uh…I just wanted to thank you…for everything.

178
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,752
Everything?

179
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:16,909
And I wanted to apologize
for getting you into this mess.

180
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:23,043
Those kids are everything to me.

181
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:33,111
If they get trafficked or…
or killed, I couldn't bare it.

182
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:36,693
I understand.

183
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,586
I was an orphan too.

184
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:50,979
I was sold to an east end gangster
who specialized in training child soldiers.

185
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,225
Crain was there too.

186
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,581
What happened?

187
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:58,757
I escaped, he didn't.

188
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:03,007
No doubt they blamed him.

189
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:05,309
Took it out in blood.

190
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:09,245
So now he blames you.

191
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,605
Yeah this is his payback.

192
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:18,835
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

193
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:20,763
It's not your fault.

194
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,604
What are we gonna do?

195
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:58,672
I worked it out.

196
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:01,182
Supply boat from the backside
of the island out of view.

197
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:05,846
And tomorrow night you'll be out of danger.
Your kids too.

198
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:07,510
It's all arranged.

199
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:09,509
And what about Crain?

200
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:12,165
I'm not doing his three kills.

201
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:18,062
Once your safe there's
only going to be one…him.

202
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,826
But they'll never let you near him.

203
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,857
They'll never know I was there.

204
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,537
I want you to hold onto something for me.

205
00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:32,660
Until I come back.

206
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,603
My father gave this to me.

207
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:41,860
It's the only memory I have of him.

208
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:48,405
I'll keep it safe.

209
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,051
That's Crain's guy.

210
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:27,428
Look at me.

211
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:32,135
You remember, make sure
I get you home. Trust me.

212
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:54,912
Bishop!!

213
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,216
Bishop!!

214
00:30:57,264 --> 00:30:58,671
Bishop!!

215
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:06,653
Bishop!!

216
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,793
Mr. Crain I have him right here.

217
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:22,943
Tell me how to find you face to face.

218
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,202
Are we done?

219
00:31:58,202 --> 00:31:59,979
Follow me.

220
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,680
Sit down.

221
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:20,645
Please, don't move.

222
00:32:20,645 --> 00:32:23,176
I'd listen to her if I were you, Arthur.

223
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,775
No need for guards or guns when the man
you want's sitting on a pound of syntax.

224
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:30,410
How did you find me, right?

225
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:33,703
What? No, 'Hello. Nice to see
you after all these years'?

226
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:38,159
But then you always were
one for getting down to business.

227
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:40,323
How did I find you?

228
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:43,442
You should know better than anyone, Arthur.

229
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:45,022
There's no privacy anymore.

230
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:48,696
Not with wonderful things like
facial recognition and…

231
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,627
satellite tracking.

232
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:54,139
I'm going to give you
something I never give anyone:

233
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:56,375
The chance to walk way.

234
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,745
Give me the girl... and walk away.

235
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:03,021
I see you've developed a
sense of humor over the years.

236
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:08,559
But if it's all the same, no,
I need you. You're the best.

237
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:12,173
Open it.

238
00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:16,987
I need you
to eliminate three people.

239
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:18,939
And this is the first.

240
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:21,987
His name is Krill.
Mass murder and warlord.

241
00:33:22,507 --> 00:33:24,943
He's also the highest profile arms dealer in Africa.

242
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:28,973
He's imprisoned on Penjara Kaedah in Malaysia.

243
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:32,006
His imprisonment is what keeps him secure.

244
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,367
It's impossible for his
enemies to get to him.

245
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:35,811
And this?

246
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:39,796
It's important that you
swallow it only after the kill.

247
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:42,799
Or the fuel cell will degrade
and we'll never find you.

248
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,291
Where is Gina?

249
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:48,301
Do the three kills, Arthur.
Get the girl back.

250
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:51,391
Even if you don't love
her you at least owe her, no?

251
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:54,357
I mean she's in this shit because of you.

252
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:56,251
How do I know you'll keep her alive?

253
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:59,413
Finish your kill,
get a video call.

254
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,993
After the last one you'll receive
instructions where to find her.

255
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:04,617
And your word's good is it?

256
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:06,667
Good heavens, absolutely not.

257
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:10,591
But I do have a very keen
sense of self-preservation.

258
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:14,050
I know that cheating you
will only make me your target.

259
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,821
And since that concludes
our business for the moment,

260
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:22,725
I wish you 'bon chance'.

261
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:32,299
Subtitled created by Freaky.

262
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:55,824
Let's get moving sweetheart, come on.

263
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:13,306
The prison is seventy miles out to sea.

264
00:35:13,306 --> 00:35:16,538
Set off cliffs more than a hundred meters high.

265
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,197
And surrounded by shark infested waters.

266
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:22,978
So basically impossible to get in.

267
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:24,675
And nobody has ever gotten out.

268
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:27,190
It will be even harder
to get your man.

269
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,073
He's surrounded at all times by
his team of loyal soldiers.

270
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,424
Getting in alone will be your main challenge.

271
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:34,181
It's powerful stuff.

272
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:36,493
Hope you know what you're doing.

273
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:08,711
Hey!! What? What?
What do you want.

274
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:12,257
Hey, stop.
Stop it.

275
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,435
Fuck you.

276
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:26,687
You're under arrest!

277
00:38:29,252 --> 00:38:30,583
Line up!

278
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,065
Go.

279
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:38,865
Go.

280
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:45,221
Keep going!

281
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:52,277
Bishop, remember,
it has to look like an accident.

282
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:57,134
If he dies with a knife in his
back no one will be there to pick you up.

283
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:01,942
Good luck.

284
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:28,643
- Who the hell is that?
- Krill.

285
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:32,899
He was an executioner for
people like Charles Taylor…

286
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,287
and the Sudanese militia.

287
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:38,726
People say he ate
the hearts of his victims.

288
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:43,658
Some have relatives who want revenge.

289
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:50,008
Like that guy over there.
He used to be Krill's best assassin.

290
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:52,611
Now all he wants to do is kill him.

291
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:57,633
But he has his bodyguards
constantly protecting him.

292
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,760
You're a good man.

293
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,818
Why don't you join us for dinner?

294
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:49,455
I'm not sure I like the company.

295
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:54,274
Then they are not invited.

296
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:30,323
Hey. Come, come.
Come in my friend.

297
00:43:32,161 --> 00:43:40,218
There are six murders and twenty-three
stabbings every week in this shit hole.

298
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,477
Most of them pointed at me.

299
00:43:43,797 --> 00:43:48,118
That guy you stopped.
He used to work for me.

300
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:53,692
Oh maybe he is still
upset that I killed his brother

301
00:43:55,766 --> 00:44:01,378
Loyalty is a scarce commodity
in my line of business.

302
00:44:04,053 --> 00:44:10,152
Oh yes! How did you know that
he would want to kill me?

303
00:44:10,078 --> 00:44:11,626
I hear things.

304
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,212
My ju-ju tells me everything
that I need to hear.

305
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,652
Maybe you weren't
listening hard enough.

306
00:44:22,613 --> 00:44:25,086
Do you know who I am?

307
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:30,303
Krill. You run this place.

308
00:44:30,303 --> 00:44:34,643
Exactly. And when I get of this place,

309
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:38,080
I'm going to run all of Africa!

310
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,576
There could be a
job for a man like you.

311
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,726
I already have a job.

312
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,482
- What job?
- You.

313
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:01,773
Let the man pray.

314
00:48:01,716 --> 00:48:03,214
Here he comes.

315
00:48:13,844 --> 00:48:16,868
He's right below us.
Bring up the net.

316
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:17,869
Bring up the net.

317
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:37,676
Nothing in the net, sir.

318
00:48:37,676 --> 00:48:39,507
What the fuck'?

319
00:48:40,311 --> 00:48:42,266
Looking for someone?

320
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:45,841
I want my call.

321
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:52,440
Bishop survived.

322
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:03,497
- Hello, Arthur.
- Happy now?

323
00:49:04,048 --> 00:49:05,681
Nice work on Krill.

324
00:49:05,771 --> 00:49:10,412
Prison food'll kill you.
Put Gina on.

325
00:49:10,439 --> 00:49:11,630
Here's your boyfriend.

326
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:13,270
Hi.

327
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,413
- How are you holding up?
- I'm okay.

328
00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:18,629
Crain wanted me to let you  know that um…

329
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:24,945
you have 36 hours to eliminate the
next target or they will eliminate me.

330
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:27,495
That won't happen.

331
00:49:27,495 --> 00:49:30,061
Okay, this is all very sweet, Arthur.

332
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:33,798
But you heard what she said.
You need to pick up the pace.

333
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:37,201
This is your next kill. Adrian Cook.

334
00:49:57,549 --> 00:49:59,687
Did Bishop tell you where he got this?

335
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:05,467
It belonged to his father.

336
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,231
I never saw him take it off. Never.

337
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:15,247
You know, I wasn't sure there was a thing
in the world that could break Arthur.

338
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:17,931
Until I saw you wearing this watch.

339
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:21,124
Now I know he'll do anything for you.

340
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,695
In the heart of downtown
Sydney at top of 58th story high rise,

341
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:47,966
is a penthouse suite
owned by Adrian Cook.

342
00:50:48,502 --> 00:50:50,999
The mining and minerals millionaire.

343
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:55,201
Few people know that he originally
made his fortune in human trafficking.

344
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:58,230
Specializing in underage sex workers.

345
00:50:58,366 --> 00:51:01,429
He has plenty of manpower
protecting him of course.

346
00:51:01,348 --> 00:51:02,846
But that's the least of it.

347
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:11,035
There you go. The Sydney Opera house
and the Harbor Bridge.

348
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:20,356
Cook's paranoia is only trumped by his ego.

349
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:22,759
Exhibit A. His cantilevered pool.

350
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:29,994
The walls and floors are all concrete.
3-feet thick.

351
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:35,796
Every door is made of
6-inch nickel chromium steel.

352
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:38,247
That's like 12 armor plates.

353
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:43,047
And the biometric sensors and retinal readers
at the access points are impossible to hack.

354
00:51:43,759 --> 00:51:45,887
It's a fortress in the sky.

355
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,302
Mr. Clark. Good to meet you.
Shall we?

356
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:24,486
So each apartment has only 300 square
meters of premium living space.

357
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,972
But this one gets the Sydney sunset.

358
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:31,990
The specifications are all in the brochure.

359
00:52:32,007 --> 00:52:35,423
Let me show you the detail floorplan.

360
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:40,285
You've got Italian tiles
running completely across here.

361
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:43,490
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sure.

362
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,744
Hello? Samantha Burns.

363
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,319
Hello?

364
00:52:54,246 --> 00:52:56,040
Sorry about that.
So where were we?

365
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,069
- You were about to tell me about the floorplans.
- Oh, yes.

366
00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:49,657
But we're not dumping on the reef.
Near is not on.

367
00:53:52,957 --> 00:53:58,197
Yeah. That's right.
Now I've gotta go.  Now I've gotta go.

368
00:57:31,934 --> 00:57:36,001
Billionaire Adrian Cook plunged from
the 56th floor to his death

369
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:41,667
this morning when the glass pool of his Sydney
penthouse collapsed. Although authorities--

370
00:57:41,702 --> 00:57:44,437
- Give him his call.
- Okay.

371
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:50,044
…death as a tragic accident
effectively ruling out foul play.

372
00:58:06,185 --> 00:58:08,152
- Ready.
- Go ahead.

373
00:58:14,846 --> 00:58:20,238
Bishop.
Your watch has stopped.

374
00:58:20,575 --> 00:58:21,873
I think it's a sign.

375
00:58:22,797 --> 00:58:25,084
Maybe it just needs cleaning.

376
00:58:25,548 --> 00:58:28,348
No, closer.

377
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:34,301
Son of a bitch!

378
00:58:52,893 --> 00:58:55,327
- Hello?
- It's the harbor master's office?

379
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:57,960
Yes, how may I assist you?

380
00:58:57,961 --> 00:59:00,295
My name is uh, Tom Silva.

381
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:03,545
Some bastard in a bloody grave
yard just screwed my vessel.

382
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:09,445
Uh, I have the hull number, but my insurance
needs the owner's details.

383
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:17,286
- Alright. Go ahead.
- WRX-489-674-2239.

384
00:59:17,062 --> 00:59:19,076
Okay. Give me one moment.

385
00:59:19,076 --> 00:59:25,148
The vessel's berth is in Sydney
Harbor on Pier 7. That's about it.

386
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:48,314
The boat you're looking
for is gone, mate.

387
00:59:48,306 --> 00:59:50,962
It's a big one, too.

388
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:55,377
Head out of the harbor.
It couldn't have gone far.

389
00:59:55,377 --> 00:59:58,008
It's your money, boss.

390
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:16,143
There. East.

391
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:20,908
Come out of the sun so he can't see you.

392
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,037
Drop it down to 60 feet.
Hold it steady.

393
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:35,972
Bishop.

394
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,421
You know your problem, Bishop?

395
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:07,561
You just can't help yourself.

396
01:04:07,246 --> 01:04:09,229
That's how I knew you'd come back for her.

397
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,244
That's your weakness.

398
01:04:12,317 --> 01:04:15,372
Now do the third kill, or the girl's dead.

399
01:04:15,969 --> 01:04:20,337
Take him down below.
And give him a proper sendoff.

400
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:20,946
Bishop, if you pull another
stunt like that, our deal is off.

401
01:05:20,946 --> 01:05:24,509
And you'll never see
your little girlfriend again.

402
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:31,754
Now, playtime is over .

403
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:37,861
Go to the port town of Varna.
On the Black Sea.

404
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:42,668
That's where you'll find your third kill.

405
01:05:43,805 --> 01:05:49,574
His name is Max Adams.
A wealthy American arms dealer.

406
01:05:56,611 --> 01:06:01,611
On the north side of Varna, you'll find a
truly vulgar memorial to Bulgarian communism.

407
01:06:02,418 --> 01:06:04,647
Adams spent a fortune restoring it.

408
01:06:04,647 --> 01:06:08,149
They're putting in the most
comprehensive security system.

409
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:20,520
But the interesting part
is what you don't see.

410
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:24,342
Hidden in the mountainside below is the subpen.

411
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:28,587
Adams stocks his U boats with
intercontinental ballistic missiles.

412
01:06:30,483 --> 01:06:33,334
Nobody gets in or out.

413
01:06:33,337 --> 01:06:35,293
Many have died trying.

414
01:06:35,327 --> 01:06:40,292
So needless to say, this will be
the hardest sub to penetrate by far.

415
01:06:40,303 --> 01:06:45,251
On top of all that, Krill and Cook's deaths
may have Adams on the defense.

416
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:53,006
You have 24 hours.

417
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:11,346
You're using me to take out the competition.

418
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:30,117
We will dispatch the helicopter.

419
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:28,788
Once you reach the compound, you'll have
to deal with several waves of security.

420
01:10:38,326 --> 01:10:44,223
The building has its own power system,
oxygen supply and a state of the art panic room.

421
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,451
Good luck, brother.

422
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:19,273
Open the goddamn door.
Please.

423
01:11:32,394 --> 01:11:34,629
Call me when you know something.

424
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:43,556
No sign of the intruder, Mr. Adams.

425
01:11:43,556 --> 01:11:48,458
That's because he's sitting right in
front of me here in the safe room, jackoff.

426
01:11:49,677 --> 01:11:51,132
Magnificent.

427
01:11:51,262 --> 01:11:53,557
Even if you have all stolen and looted.

428
01:11:53,592 --> 01:11:57,517
(inaudible) features totalitarianism.
Of course it's magnificent.

429
01:11:57,517 --> 01:12:01,595
- Like uh, dinosaur bones.
- It's ugly.

430
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:04,663
Who the fuck are you?

431
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:06,405
I'm here to talk.

432
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,002
Lose your cell phone?

433
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:10,612
I should've hired
those guys in Houston.

434
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:12,792
Alright, what is it you want to talk about?

435
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:14,902
I want to help you avoid an accident.

436
01:12:14,902 --> 01:12:17,590
Krill, Cook, that was you.

437
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,705
I warned those guys that one day
Crain would come after all of us.

438
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:23,128
Cappuccino? Espresso?

439
01:12:23,128 --> 01:12:25,893
Espresso. No sugar.

440
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:31,897
Krill was a warlord but also the
number one arms dealer in Africa.

441
01:12:31,897 --> 01:12:36,657
Cook used his mining empire as a cover
to control the Asian franchise. You...

442
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:39,025
have got Europe and most of South America.

443
01:12:39,025 --> 01:12:41,642
North America too,
if you count Mexicans.

444
01:12:41,668 --> 01:12:44,172
That didn't leave much for Crain.

445
01:12:44,635 --> 01:12:46,395
So I have a deal for you.

446
01:12:46,136 --> 01:12:50,352
Hmm. Well, I'm a dealer.

447
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:52,161
We can talk about it.

448
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:02,456
I have been called a lot of
ugly names over the years.

449
01:13:02,456 --> 01:13:07,503
Communist, socialist, racist, fascist.
None of which is true of course.

450
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:11,755
Well, I'm certainly not a communist.

451
01:13:12,315 --> 01:13:16,451
- You just admire their architecture.
- I believe in fair play.

452
01:13:16,445 --> 01:13:21,085
I saw the David and Goliath story play
out on the frontlines of Vietnam.

453
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,130
Soviets in Afghanistan. Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

454
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:29,473
Chemical weapons on the Kurds.
The little guy is always gonna need a slingshot,

455
01:13:29,473 --> 01:13:32,346
and somebody's always gonna pay for it.

456
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,587
An arms dealer with a moral clause.

457
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:36,318
Uh-hmm.

458
01:13:36,574 --> 01:13:38,350
Let's talk about Crain.

459
01:13:38,813 --> 01:13:41,030
We both need him gone.

460
01:13:41,314 --> 01:13:44,872
The question is how do we accomplish that.
He's got an army around him.

461
01:13:44,872 --> 01:13:48,499
We need something tempting enough so
that Crain uses his men to go after it.

462
01:13:49,303 --> 01:13:50,844
What do you have in mind?

463
01:13:51,195 --> 01:13:52,748
Your submarine pen.

464
01:13:53,148 --> 01:13:59,227
Have them search for weapons,
treasure... your corpse.

465
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:00,513
What?

466
01:14:00,513 --> 01:14:03,665
You'll have to die.

467
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,649
Well, that's easy. Although it will cost
a tremendous amount of money.

468
01:14:08,818 --> 01:14:10,465
You can afford it.

469
01:14:22,701 --> 01:14:24,541
Are the boats all secured?

470
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:25,605
Yes, sir.

471
01:14:25,981 --> 01:14:28,455
- Batteries charged?
- Yes, sir.

472
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,669
- Fully provisioned?
- Yes, sir.

473
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:32,478
You got those Russian girls
in here last night for the crew?

474
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:33,479
Yes, sir.

475
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:36,851
Well, looks like we're ready to go.

476
01:14:43,888 --> 01:14:45,033
Stay here.

477
01:15:16,191 --> 01:15:19,227
There was an explosion and
Mr. Adams slipped into the water.

478
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:21,610
His security, they tried to reach him.

479
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:24,912
But the rocks came down and he
was buried under the water.

480
01:15:24,912 --> 01:15:26,210
Gone.

481
01:15:35,783 --> 01:15:40,441
I never imagined dying would be
so goddamned invigorating.

482
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:44,485
Stay out of sight for two days. After that,
you can invigorate all you want.

483
01:16:07,254 --> 01:16:08,653
You calling for the driver?

484
01:16:08,654 --> 01:16:11,501
Making dinner reservations?

485
01:16:11,751 --> 01:16:13,681
Checking in with mom?

486
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:15,742
I'm calling Crain to make
sure he takes the bait.

487
01:16:23,485 --> 01:16:26,077
You do know how to put on a show.

488
01:16:26,758 --> 01:16:30,149
There's a pier a few miles north of
Varna. Be there tomorrow with the girl.

489
01:16:30,298 --> 01:16:32,637
Not until I see Adams' body.

490
01:16:32,994 --> 01:16:35,907
You'll find him with his most prized possessions.

491
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:38,117
In his submarine pen.

492
01:16:45,126 --> 01:16:48,053
Get over there.
Find Adams' body.

493
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,441
Secure everything inside the pen.

494
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:54,113
And uh, what about Bishop?

495
01:16:54,553 --> 01:16:55,658
Kill him.

496
01:18:08,908 --> 01:18:11,724
Jeremy, point the camera
forward so I can see.

497
01:18:31,027 --> 01:18:33,530
All right. Let's go.
Fan out.

498
01:18:49,944 --> 01:18:51,460
Where the hell is Bishop?

499
01:18:54,598 --> 01:18:55,907
Clear.

500
01:18:55,908 --> 01:18:57,803
2,1 clear.

501
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:04,679
Contact right rear.

502
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,011
Take cover.

503
01:20:14,047 --> 01:20:16,160
Motherfucker!

504
01:20:32,022 --> 01:20:35,385
- Anything?
- No sign of him, Mr. Crain.

505
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:40,711
Stay sharp. Bishop's coming.
You can count on it.

506
01:20:46,698 --> 01:20:49,373
- What is going on?
- Your boyfriend is coming to die.

507
01:20:50,691 --> 01:20:53,956
And you're the bait. Move.

508
01:21:23,617 --> 01:21:24,758
Come on, Bishop.

509
01:21:27,351 --> 01:21:29,668
I know you're not gonna let her die.

510
01:22:08,886 --> 01:22:10,570
Bring her to the bridge.

511
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:22,774
Let's move.

512
01:25:18,032 --> 01:25:21,594
Let's go. We got three
minutes before it blows.

513
01:25:28,846 --> 01:25:31,194
Gina. You okay?

514
01:25:31,213 --> 01:25:32,961
I'll be fine.

515
01:25:36,002 --> 01:25:38,299
Let me see. Ah, shit.

516
01:25:38,907 --> 01:25:41,587
I saw Crain doing
something on the console.

517
01:25:43,686 --> 01:25:46,837
- What is going on?
- Crain is trying to kill us.

518
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:48,002
Let's go.

519
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:52,038
- Get this shit on the boat now.
- Yes, sir.

520
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:55,689
What is this?

521
01:25:55,689 --> 01:25:57,029
Just get in.

522
01:25:58,141 --> 01:25:59,403
Wait.

523
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,749
What are you doing?

524
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,450
Making sure you'll live.

525
01:26:01,996 --> 01:26:05,144
No. Come with me! Bishop!

526
01:26:06,056 --> 01:26:08,201
- Here he is!
- Bishop!

527
01:26:15,599 --> 01:26:17,632
Find him…now!

528
01:26:17,633 --> 01:26:18,353
Got him. Move!

529
01:26:18,353 --> 01:26:21,303
Fletcher!
Let's get going.

530
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:37,989
- You never asked why ?
- I know why.

531
01:27:38,463 --> 01:27:43,109
'Cause I got out, and you didn't.
And here we are again.

532
01:27:43,297 --> 01:27:44,614
You deserted me.

533
01:27:44,614 --> 01:27:47,230
It's time you paid for that.

534
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:48,668
No chance.

535
01:27:50,095 --> 01:27:52,010
You're gonna get your third kill

536
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:56,135
This one won't look like an accident.

537
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:50,215
You're a dead man, Bishop.

538
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:58,969
You might get off the boat, but you'll never
swim far enough away before she blows.

539
01:28:59,474 --> 01:29:01,195
Who said I was swimming?

540
01:29:07,123 --> 01:29:09,438
Bishop!

541
01:29:12,898 --> 01:29:15,361
Bishop!

542
01:29:17,321 --> 01:29:20,352
Bishop!

543
01:29:45,355 --> 01:29:46,788
Hey!

544
01:29:47,645 --> 01:29:49,481
Hey!

545
01:30:14,167 --> 01:30:16,429
Were there any survivors?

546
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:19,041
No.

547
01:30:30,382 --> 01:30:33,811
That's the anchor compartment.
Nothing more out there.

548
01:30:33,811 --> 01:30:36,079
Bishop never made it.

549
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:38,561
Even legends die.

550
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,160
Dear…Mei. I'm back in
Cambodia with the kids.

551
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,075
The water filter's working.

552
01:31:06,075 --> 01:31:08,771
Thank you so much
for your generous gift.

553
01:31:08,889 --> 01:31:13,339
You have to come here some day.
I think you'd like it a lot.

554
01:31:13,525 --> 01:31:16,081
Bishop would have loved it.

555
01:31:16,082 --> 01:31:21,145
See you soon. I hope.
Lots of love. Gina.

556
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:33,991
Self-contained reinforced chamber
to house the anchor chain of any ship.

557
01:32:37,826 --> 01:32:42,984
Steel chamber containing trapped air, allowing
divers to breath normally while submerged underwater.

558
01:32:50,812 --> 01:32:52,923
Clever son of a bitch!

559
01:33:11,731 --> 01:33:13,361
Sneaky bastard!

560
01:33:13,514 --> 01:33:16,616
Bang, you're dead.

561
01:33:20,133 --> 01:33:24,894
