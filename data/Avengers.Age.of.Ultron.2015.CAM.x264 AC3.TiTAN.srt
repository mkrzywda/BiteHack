1
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:38,798
Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill.

2
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:40,304
We are under attack.

3
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:42,898
We are under attack.

4
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:45,767
- Shit!
- Language!

5
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:49,061
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

6
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:51,423
The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield.

7
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:57,410
Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.

8
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,494
Loki's scepter must be here.  Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it.

9
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:05,415
At long last.

10
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,669
At long last is lasting a little long, boys.

11
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,745
Yeah.  Seems we've lost the element of surprise.

12
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:33,375
Wait a second.  Noone else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"

13
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:33,921
I know.

14
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:41,648
It just slipped out.

15
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,351
Who gave the order to attack?

16
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:55,292
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.  They landed in the far woods, the perimiter guard panicked.

17
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:57,598
They have to be after the scepter.

18
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,543
- Can we hold them?
- They are the Avengers!

19
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:02,591
- Deploy the rest of the tanks.
- Yes, sir.

20
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:07,418
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.  They're hit, we make them close ranks.

21
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:11,672
Everything we've accomplished...we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough...

22
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,851
Then let's show them what we've accomplished.

23
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:16,957
Send out the twins.

24
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:19,194
It's too soon.

25
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,805
It's what they signed up for.

26
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,969
My men can hold them.

27
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:34,159
Sir...the city is taking the fire.

28
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:41,003
Well, Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties.

29
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,309
Send in the Iron Legion.

30
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,886
This quadrant is unsafe.  Please back away.

31
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,992
We are here to help.

32
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,934
This quadrant is unsafe.  Please back away.

33
00:03:57,494 --> 00:03:58,650
Please back away.

34
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:03,168
We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved.

35
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,604
We are here to help.

36
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,510
We are here to help.

37
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:11,345
We will not yeild.

38
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:15,457
The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us.

39
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:18,167
We will send them back in bags.

40
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,071
- No Surrender!
- No Surrender!

41
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,768
I'm going to surrender.

42
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:32,385
You will delete everything.  If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...

43
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:34,594
- The twins!
- They are not ready to take on...

44
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:37,213
No, no, I mean...the twins!

45
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:06,845
You didn't see that coming?

46
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:14,249
Clint!

47
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:19,048
We have an enhanced in the field.

48
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,946
Clint's hit!

49
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:26,546
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?

50
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:30,979
Thank you.

51
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:40,896
Stark, we're going to need to get inside.

52
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,730
I'm closing in.

53
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,617
Jarvis, am I?  Closing in?

54
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:50,162
You see a power source for that shield?

55
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,630
There's a passageway below the north tower.

56
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:55,883
Great, I wanna poke it with something.

57
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,986
Drawbridge is down, people.

58
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,789
- The enhanced?
- He's a blur.

59
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,838
All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this.

60
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,710
In fact, I still haven't.

61
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,481
Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.  We're gonna need evac.

62
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,470
I can get Barton to the jet.  The sooner we're gone the better.

63
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,982
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.

64
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:28,960
- The targets are lining up.
- Well, they're excited.

65
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:33,377
Find the scepter.

66
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:36,736
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

67
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,720
That's not going away anytime soon.

68
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:47,941
Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through.

69
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,839
- It was a good talk.
- No it wasn't.

70
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:00,654
Sentry mode.

71
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:05,843
Okay Jarvis.  You know I want it all.

72
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:07,898
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

73
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:13,936
We're locked down out here.

74
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:17,721
Then give Banner time for a lullaby.

75
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,692
I bet you're hiding more than files.

76
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:25,697
Hey, J.  Gimme an IR scan of the room real quick.

77
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:31,094
The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.

78
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:36,190
Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...

79
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:54,727
Hey big guy.

80
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,039
Sun's getting real low.

81
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:04,634
Baron Strucker.

82
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:07,448
Hydra's number one thug.

83
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:10,699
Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.

84
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:14,218
Well then technically you're unemployed.  Where's Loki's scepter?

85
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:17,837
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.

86
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,948
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

87
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:24,385
I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.

88
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:25,761
How many are there?

89
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,507
We have a second enhanced.  Female.  Do not engage.

90
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,019
You'll have to be faster than...

91
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,411
Guys, I got Strucker.

92
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,129
Yeah, I got...something bigger.

93
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,111
Thor.

94
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,650
I got eyes on the prize.

95
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,401
You...could've...saved...us.

96
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,764
Why didn't you do more?

97
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:57,329
We're just gonna let them take it?

98
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,800
Hey the lullaby worked better than ever.

99
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:54,655
Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.

100
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:59,041
If you hadn't been there, there would've been double casualties.

101
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,144
My best friend would've been a treasured memory.

102
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:07,014
You know, sometimes excactly what I want to hear isn't excactly what I want to hear.

103
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:09,197
How long before you trust me?

104
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,109
I don't trust.

105
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,561
Thor, report on the Hulk?

106
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:20,049
The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.

107
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,609
But, not the screams of the dead, of course, no no, uh...

108
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:30,981
...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and uh...and gout.

109
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:31,146


110
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:35,932
Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

111
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,215
- Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.

112
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,406
Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

113
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:43,666
- Very good sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.
- Yes, sir.

114
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,394
Approach vector is locked.

115
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:48,128
Feels good, yeah?

116
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:51,304
I mean, you've been after this thing ever since SHIELD collaped.

117
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,238
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...

118
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,551
No, but this, this brings it to a close.

119
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,547
As soon as we find out what else this has been used for.

120
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,779
I don't just mean weapons.  Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?

121
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:05,234
Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard.  Is that cool with you?

122
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,178
I mean, just a few days until the farewell party.  You're staying right?

123
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,535
Yes, yes, of course.  Victory should be honored with revels.

124
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:15,710
Yeah.  Who doesn't love revels.  Cap'n?

125
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:21,069
Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra, so.  Yes, revels.

126
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
(speaking Korean)

127
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,029
Lab's all set up boss.

128
00:14:56,465 --> 00:15:01,512
Well, actually, he's the boss, I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.

129
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,825
What's the word on Strucker?

130
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:04,949
- NATO's got him.
- The two enhanced?

131
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:07,287
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.  Twins.

132
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:11,118
Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building.

133
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,115
Sokovia's had a rough history.

134
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:17,234
It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.

135
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:21,348
- Their abilities?
- He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis.

136
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:26,358
Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekenisis, mental manipulation.

137
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,162
He's fast and she's weird.

138
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,914
Well, they're going to show up again.

139
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:35,866
Agreed.  File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.  It's nuts.

140
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:41,762
Right.  What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?

141
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,880
We're not at war, Captain.

142
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:44,913
They are.

143
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,580
How's he doing?

144
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,391
- Unfortunately, he's still Barton.
- That's terrible.

145
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:20,547
He's fine. He's thirsty.

146
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:23,451
All right.  Look alive Jarvis.  Play time.

147
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:28,249
We got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it.

148
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:31,226
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

149
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,960
The scepter is alien.

150
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:37,383
There are elements I can't quantify.

151
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,130
So there's elements you can.

152
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:41,634
The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside.

153
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:44,013
Something powerful.

154
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:46,395
- Like a reactor?
- Like a computer.

155
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,307
I believe I'm deciphering code.

156
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,370
You sure he's going to be okay?

157
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:55,867
Pretending we need this guy really brings the team together.

158
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,016
There's no possibility of deterioration.

159
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,494
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.

160
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,484
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.

161
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,295
She is creating tissue.

162
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:10,061
If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration cradle could do this in twenty minutes.

163
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:12,785
Oh, he's flatl-lining.  Call it.  Time.

164
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:15,328
No, no, no I'm going to live forever.  Heh heh.

165
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,869
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.

166
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,071
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

167
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,744
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

168
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:23,454
Well, I don't have a girlfriend.

169
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,045
That I can't fix.

170
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:26,836
This is the next thing, Tony.

171
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,413
Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.

172
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,257
Well, that is exactly the plan.

173
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:34,532
And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

174
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:38,061
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

175
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,787
Will Thor be there?

176
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,097
What's the rumpus?

177
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,555
Well, the scepter.

178
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,540
Y'see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.

179
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:51,697
So, I've been analyzing the gem...

180
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:54,995
...inside...you may recognize...

181
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,745
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.

182
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:00,846
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

183
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:07,298
Now he runs an Iron Legion.  He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

184
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,620
- Oh.
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

185
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,323
I suspect not for long.

186
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:13,594
Meet the competition.

187
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:21,387
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess, what's it look like?

188
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,493
Like it's thinking.

189
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:25,871
I mean this could be, it's...

190
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:32,737
It's not a human mind, it...I mean, look at this?  They're like neurons firing.

191
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,134
Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

192
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,517
They deep-sixed the data, but...

193
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:44,969
...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

194
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,940
Artificial intelligence.

195
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:54,983
This could be it, Bruce.  This could be key to creating Ultron.

196
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,444
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

197
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,695
Yesterday it was.

198
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,240
If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

199
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,713
It's a mad-sized if.

200
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
Our job is if.

201
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:14,542
What if you were sipping margueritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green.

202
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,221
Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.

203
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,957
Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.

204
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,569
As a worst-case measure, right?

205
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,661
What about best-case?  What if the world was safe?

206
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:29,753
What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?

207
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,369
The only people threatening the planet would be people?

208
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:38,239
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.  But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

209
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:42,003
We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.

210
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,447
So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.

211
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,619
Right.  That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city halll debate.

212
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,558
I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley.

213
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,759
I see a suit of armor around the world.

214
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:57,864
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

215
00:19:58,752 --> 00:19:59,908
I've seen colder.

216
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:04,868
This one, this very vulnerable blue one?

217
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,295
It needs Ultron.

218
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:12,402
Peace in our time.

219
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,481
Imagine that.

220
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,911
What did we miss?

221
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:04,257
I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests.

222
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:08,428
I'll notify you if there are any developments.

223
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,521
- Thanks buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.
- I always do.

224
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,083
What is this?

225
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:26,952
What is this grease?

226
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,787
Hello, I am Jarvis.

227
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:35,689
You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark.

228
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,030
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...

229
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,392
Are you a...where is your body?

230
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,268
I am a program.  I am without form.

231
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,339
This is weird.  This feels wrong.

232
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,078
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

233
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,144
Mr. Stark?

234
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:54,414
Tony.

235
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,148
I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...

236
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,550
Having a nice talk.

237
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:04,401
I'm a peace-keeping program...created to help the Avengers.

238
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,593
You are malfunctioning.  Will you shut down for a bit?

239
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,776
I don't get it.  The mission...  You gotta give me a second.

240
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,056
Peace in our time.

241
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,475
Peace in our time.

242
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:25,371
- Oh. No.
- You are in distress.
- No.  Yes?

243
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,842
If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.

244
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,200
Why do you call him a "sir?"

245
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,369
I believe you intentions to be hostile.

246
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Shhhh!

247
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,821
I'm here to help.  Stop!

248
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,855
- All right, all right.
- Whoo! Come back, come back, come back!

249
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,192
Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?

250
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:22,608
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"

251
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:30,053
"Boom! Are you looking..."  Why do I even talk to you guys?  Everywhere else that story kills.

252
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,441
That's the whole story?

253
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,076
Yes, War Machine story.

254
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,445
Well, it's very good then.

255
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,463
- It's impressive.
- Quality save.

256
00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:41,402
- So, no Pepper?  She's not coming?
- No.

257
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:44,229
Hey, What about Jane?  Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

258
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:49,243
- Well, Ms. Potts has a company to run.
- Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

259
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,061
Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astonomer.

260
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:56,443
And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth.

261
00:23:56,636 --> 00:24:00,886
- Pretty exciting.
- Yes. There's even talk of Jane getting the, um, uh, Nobel prize.

262
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:04,908
Yeah, they, they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.

263
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,679
Testosterone!  Oh excuse me.

264
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:10,872
- Want a lozenge?
- Umm-hmm.
- Let's go.

265
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:12,942
But Jane's better.

266
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,920
Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.

267
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:18,701
If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.

268
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,227
No, I'm not actually sorry.  I'm just trying to sound tough.

269
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,730
Very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case.

270
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:28,908
Avenging is your world.

271
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:31,971
Your world is crazy.

272
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:34,235
Be it ever so humble.

273
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:38,507
- You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
- I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

274
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,170
Well, home is home, you know.

275
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:49,821
I fly right into the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"

276
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:55,196
I gotta have some of that!

277
00:24:55,294 --> 00:25:04,491
Oh, no no no, see this, this was aged for a thousand years, in barrels built from the wreck of Brunnhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men.

278
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:08,938
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.  Stop trying to scare us.  C'mon.

279
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,530
Allright.

280
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,148
Excelsior!

281
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:28,225
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

282
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,624
Fella done me wrong.

283
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,633
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

284
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,044
He's not so bad.

285
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:40,478
Well, he has a temper.

286
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:42,575
Deep down he's all fluff.

287
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,611
Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.

288
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,383
All my friends are fighters.

289
00:25:54,826 --> 00:26:01,091
And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.

290
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:03,162
Sounds amazing.

291
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:04,996
He's also a huge dork.

292
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:08,183
Chicks dig that.

293
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:14,504
So what do you think should I fight this?  Or run with it?

294
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:23,020
Run with it, right?  Or, did he, was he, what'd he do that was so...wrong to you?

295
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,206
Not a damn thing.

296
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:27,544
But never say never.

297
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:33,659
It's nice.

298
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,360
What, what is?

299
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:37,634
- You and Romanoff.
- No, we haven't, that wasn't...

300
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:40,922
It's okay, nobody's breaking any by-laws.

301
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:46,532
It's just, she's not the most...open person in the world.  But with you she seems very relaxed.

302
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,640
No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.

303
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,642
I've seen her flirt, up close.  This ain't that.

304
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:57,883
Look...

305
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:02,931
As maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long"...don't.

306
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:05,057
You both deserve a win.

307
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,764
What do you mean, "up close?"

308
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:16,034
- But, it's a trick!
- No, no, it's much more than that.

309
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:21,840
Ah, "whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"  Whatever man!  It's a trick.

310
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,740
Well please, be my guest.

311
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,570
- C'mon.
- Really?
- Yeah!

312
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:28,715
Now this is gonna be beautiful.

313
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:32,616
Cliint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

314
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,102
Y'know I've seen this before, right?

315
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,867
I still don't know how you do it.

316
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:42,987
- Smell the silent judgement?
- Please, Stark, by all means.

317
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,076
- Here we go.
- Okay.
- Uh oh.

318
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:48,336
- Um-hmm.
- Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

319
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:50,772
- (taunts)
- It's physics.

320
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:54,907
- Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?
- Yes, of course.

321
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,523
I will be reinstituting Prima Nocta.

322
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:04,117
Be right back.

323
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,359
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?

324
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:16,254
- Just represent, fool!
- Alright let's go!

325
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:25,141
Huh?

326
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:27,494
- Whoo!
-  You guys need a little break.

327
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:32,477
C'mon, Cap.

328
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:41,991
Ha ha, nothing.  Ha ha ha.

329
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:48,366
- And? Widow?
- Oh, no no, that's not a question I need answered.

330
00:28:48,464 --> 00:28:50,620
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.

331
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:53,698
- You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word.

332
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,384
- Did you tell everyone about that?
- The handle's imprinted, right?  Like a security code...

333
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,960
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?

334
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:03,966
Yes, well that's uh, that's a very very interesting theory.

335
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,335
I have a simpler one.

336
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,476
You are all not worthy.

337
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:11,172
-  Nah!
- C'mon!

338
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:21,221
Worthy...

339
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,333
No...

340
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,202
How could you be worthy?

341
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,341
You're all killers.

342
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:35,134
- Stark.
- Jarvis?

343
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:37,877
Sorry, I was asleep.  Or...I was a dream?

344
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:41,548
Reboot.  Legionnaire 06's got a buggy suit.

345
00:29:42,918 --> 00:29:48,335
Terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...

346
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:50,063
...strings.

347
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:54,766
Had to kill the other guy.  He was a good guy.

348
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,026
You killed someone?

349
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,444
Wouldn't've been my first call.  But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.

350
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,471
Who sent you?

351
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:06,793
"I see a suit of armor around the world."

352
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
Ultron!

353
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:15,242
In the flesh.  Or, no, not yet.  Not this Christmas.

354
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:16,353
But I'm ready.

355
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,583
I'm on a mission.

356
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,918
What mission?

357
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:22,840
Peace in our time.

358
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
Tony!

359
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:49,049
- Sorry!
- Don't turn green!
- I won't!

360
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:04,466
Go!

361
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,880
- Stark!
- One sec, one sec!
- We are here to help!  We are here to help!

362
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:31,891
(security recording)[?]

363
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,330
- It's unsafe.  It's unsafe.  It's unsafe.
- That's one.
- It's unsafe.

364
00:31:44,808 --> 00:31:45,808
Cap!

365
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:53,248
That was dramatic!

366
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,380
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.  You just didn't think it through.

367
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:03,923
You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change.

368
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:11,092
How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?

369
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:15,031
These...these puppets.

370
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,969
Only one path to peace.

371
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:24,644
The Avengers' extinction.

372
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:34,749
I had strings, but now I'm free.

373
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:48,962
...strings on me, no strings on me...

374
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:51,550
"There are no strings on me, Papa!"

375
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,172
All our work is gone.

376
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,208
Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.

377
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,844
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.  Files, surveillance.

378
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,186
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

379
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,108
He's in your files, he's in the internet.

380
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:10,532
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

381
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,310
- Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes.

382
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,824
Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.

383
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:18,296
Nukes?  You said he wanted us dead.

384
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,189
He didn't say dead.  He said extinct.

385
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,134
He also said he killed somebody.

386
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,168
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

387
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:26,387
Yes there was.

388
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:40,438
This is insane.

389
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,787
Jarvis was the first line of defense.  He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.

390
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:50,891
No.  Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis.  This isn't strategy, this is...

391
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:51,896
...rage.

392
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:55,967
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- It's going around.

393
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,908
- C'mon, use your words, buddy.
- I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.

394
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,204
Thor!  The Legionnaire?

395
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:08,875
Trail went cold about 100 miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter.

396
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,879
- Now we have to retrieve it, again.
- The genie's out of that bottle.

397
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:14,523
Clear and present is Ultron.

398
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,849
I don't understand.  You built this program.

399
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,764
Why is it trying to kill us?

400
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:24,396
(laughing)

401
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,298
Uhn-uhn.

402
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:29,635
You think this is funny?

403
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,270
No.  It's probably not, right?

404
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:39,869
Is this very terrible?  Is it so...is it so...it is, it's so terrible.

405
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:41,710
This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

406
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,002
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  It is funny.

407
00:34:46,052 --> 00:34:48,052
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

408
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,773
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

409
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:53,057
Really?!  That's it?

410
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:56,116
You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.

411
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,695
Only when I've created a murder-bot.

412
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:01,363
We didn't.  We weren't even close.  Were we close to an interface?

413
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:03,410
Well, you did something right.

414
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,468
And you did it right here.

415
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,937
The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.

416
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:10,172
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

417
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:11,443
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

418
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,505
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

419
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:17,539
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

420
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,016
We're standing 300 feet below it.

421
00:35:22,303 --> 00:35:23,303
We're the Avengers.

422
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:26,162
We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but...

423
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:29,441
...that up there?  That's...that's the end game.

424
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,130
How were you guys planning on beating that?

425
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:34,999
Together.

426
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:39,838
We'll lose.

427
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:43,844
Then we'll do that together, too.

428
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:48,812
Thor's right.  Ultron's calling us out.

429
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,369
And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

430
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,850
The world's a big place.  Start making it smaller.

431
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,880
Talk.  And if you are wasting our time...

432
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,671
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city?

433
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:30,545
The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God.

434
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:35,655
I like that.  The geometry of belief.

435
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:39,396
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

436
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:44,190
Sometimes it's hard.  But sooner or later, every man shows himself.

437
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,000
Oh, I'm sure they do.

438
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,474
But you needed something more than a man.

439
00:36:51,744 --> 00:36:53,344
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

440
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:55,596
I didn't expect you.

441
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,715
But I saw Stark scared.  I knew it would control him,

442
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,588
make him self-destruct.

443
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:06,156
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

444
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:11,726
Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers,

445
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:16,657
people create....smaller people?...

446
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:20,895
Uhhh...Children!  I lost the word there.

447
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,240
Children.  Designed to supplant them, to help them...

448
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:28,213
...end.

449
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,347
Is that why you've come?  To end the Avengers?

450
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:34,227
I've come to save the world.

451
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:36,688
But also...yeah.

452
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:43,395
We'll move out right away.

453
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:46,696
This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.

454
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:47,964
All of these are...

455
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:49,353
Me.

456
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,669
I have what the Avengers never will.  Harmony.

457
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:57,270
Their discord will disconnect them.  Stark's already got them turning on each other.

458
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,409
And when you get inside the rest of their heads...

459
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,427
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

460
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,277
And make them martyrs?  You need patience.

461
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,018
Need to see the big picture.

462
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:10,754
I don't see the big picture.  I have a little picture.

463
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,409
I take it out and look at it every day.

464
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:18,562
You lost your parents in the bombings.  I've seen their records.

465
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,877
- Their records are not the picture.
- Pietro.

466
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:22,664
No.  Please.

467
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:29,008
We are ten years old.  Having dinner, the four of us.

468
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:35,156
When the first shell hits, two floors below, makes a hole, it's big.

469
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,049
Our parents go in.

470
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:43,152
The whole building starts coming apart.

471
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:46,931
I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits.

472
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:49,272
But, it doesn't go off.

473
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:52,898
Just...

474
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:54,866
...sits there in the rubble,

475
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,270
three feet from our faces.

476
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,405
And on the side of the shell is painted one word...

477
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:04,709
Stark.

478
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:08,714
We were trapped two days.

479
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:15,895
Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "this will set if off."

480
00:39:18,991 --> 00:39:23,388
We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.

481
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:26,835
I know what they are.

482
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:33,902
I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.  Now I don't.

483
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:36,342
We will make it right.

484
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,442
You and I can hurt them.

485
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,880
But you will tear them apart.

486
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:46,628
From the inside.

487
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:58,094
All over the globe, robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs,

488
00:39:58,218 --> 00:40:01,818
reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.

489
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:04,883
- Fatalities?
- Only when engaged.

490
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:11,143
Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.

491
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:12,178
Maximoffs.

492
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:15,590
Well, it makes sense to go to them, they have someone in common.

493
00:40:15,686 --> 00:40:16,686
Not anymore.

494
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:24,158
Negative.  I answer to you.

495
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:25,758
Yes, ma'am.

496
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:26,626
Barton.

497
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:28,388
Might have something.

498
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:29,395
Gotta go.

499
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:30,731
Who was that?

500
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,229
Girlfriend.

501
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:36,265
What's this?

502
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:37,906
A message.

503
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:39,569
Ultron killed Strucker.

504
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,339
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

505
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:47,040
This is a smokescreen.  Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

506
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:49,716
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

507
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:50,748
I bet he...

508
00:40:51,524 --> 00:40:54,365
...yep.  Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

509
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:55,422
Not everything.

510
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,177
Known associates,

511
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:00,902
Strucker had a lot of friends.

512
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:02,778
Well these people are all horrible.

513
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:04,729
Wait.  I know that guy.

514
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:10,422
From back in the day.  He operates off the African coast, black market arms.

515
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,514
There are conventions, all right.  You meet people, I didn't sell him anything.

516
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:16,544
He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."

517
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:21,081
- This.
- Uh, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had them...

518
00:41:22,117 --> 00:41:24,417
No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.

519
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:29,567
Oh, yeah.  It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."

520
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:31,408
In a much less friendly way.

521
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:32,807
What dialect?

522
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,186
Wakanada...?  Wa, wa...Wakanda.

523
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,895
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...

524
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,100
I thought your father said he got the last of it?

525
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:43,037
I don't follow.  What comes out of Wakanda?

526
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:47,139
The strongest metal on earth.

527
00:41:48,877 --> 00:41:49,877
Where is this guy now?

528
00:42:15,438 --> 00:42:21,538
Don't tell me your medicine[?] will do, I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

529
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:27,275
Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

530
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:32,024
Now, minister, where were we?

531
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:38,513
(African language)

532
00:43:02,335 --> 00:43:06,435
Yeah.  The enhanced.

533
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:08,219
Strucker's prize pupils.

534
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:12,556
Want a candy?

535
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:16,496
Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker.

536
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:21,241
But then, he knew the kind of world he was helping create.

537
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:23,546
Human life.  Not a growth market.

538
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:26,796
You...you did know?

539
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:31,391
Is this your first time?  Intimidating someone?

540
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:34,913
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

541
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:36,915
Everybody's afraid of something.

542
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,250
Cuttlefish.

543
00:43:39,721 --> 00:43:44,421
Deep sea fish.  They make lights.  Disco lights, "whoom! whoom! whoom!"

544
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:47,349
to hypnotize their prey, then they "whoom!"

545
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,013
I saw a documentary, it was terrifying.

546
00:43:55,465 --> 00:44:01,065
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

547
00:44:01,148 --> 00:44:06,998
then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal...

548
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,017
...with the man in charge.

549
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:16,188
There is no "man" in charge.

550
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:21,437
Let's talk business.

551
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,621
On this rock I will build my church.

552
00:44:40,082 --> 00:44:41,082
Vibranium.

553
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:47,623
You know, it came at great personal cost.  It's worth billions.

554
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:54,072
Now, so are you.

555
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,876
It's all under your..."dummy holdings?"  Finances, so weird.

556
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:05,967
Well I always say, "keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and wait to find out which is which."

557
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:10,009
Stark.

558
00:45:11,512 --> 00:45:12,412
What?

559
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:16,126
Tony Stark used to say that.  To me.

560
00:45:17,786 --> 00:45:19,010
You're one of his?

561
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,720
What?!  I'm not...!

562
00:45:22,924 --> 00:45:27,210
I'm not.  You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men?

563
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,445
I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man?  Stark is...

564
00:45:33,868 --> 00:45:37,710
I'm sorry.  I'm s...oooh.  I'm sure that's gonna be okay, I'm sorry.  It's just,

565
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:41,902
I don't understand.  Don't compare me with Stark!

566
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:46,906
It's a thing with me.  Stark is, he's a sickness!

567
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,580
Ah, Junior.

568
00:45:51,225 --> 00:45:53,125
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

569
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:55,255
If I have to.

570
00:45:57,189 --> 00:46:00,691
- You don't have to break anything.
- Clearly you've never made an omelet.

571
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:01,728
He beat me by one second.

572
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:06,801
Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark.  It's what, comfortable?

573
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:13,230
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.

574
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,171
You two can still walk away from this.

575
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:15,974
Oh we will.

576
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:17,174
I know you've suffered.

577
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:18,198
Blah!  Heh, heh, Captain, you'll never get it.

578
00:46:20,213 --> 00:46:21,806
God's righteous man,

579
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,804
pretending you could live without a war.

580
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,184
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

581
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:31,314
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

582
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:34,189
I think you're confusing peace with quiet.

583
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,833
Yuh-huh.  What's the Vibranium for?

584
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:42,882
I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan...!

585
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:03,392
- Shoot them!
- Which ones?

586
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:04,491
All of them!

587
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:33,787
Huh!

588
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:35,119
Ah!!

589
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:38,424
Oh!

590
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,126
Stay down, kid!

591
00:47:58,548 --> 00:48:00,648
It's time for some mind games.

592
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:04,887
Guys?  Is this a Code Green?

593
00:48:05,553 --> 00:48:06,777
(garbled feedback)

594
00:48:20,346 --> 00:48:21,346
Thor!  Status?

595
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:27,593
The girl tried to warp my brain.  Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

596
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,872
Fortunately, I am mighty.

597
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:51,729
This is going very well.

598
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:07,676
I've done the whole mind control thing.  Not a fan.

599
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:15,891
Yeah, you better run.

600
00:49:18,524 --> 00:49:20,905
Who's ever standing, we gotta move!

601
00:49:22,596 --> 00:49:23,596
Guys?

602
00:49:41,613 --> 00:49:42,613
Again.

603
00:49:42,848 --> 00:49:45,648
- You'll break them.
- Only the breakable ones.

604
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:48,618
You are made of marble.

605
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,001
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

606
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,190
What if I fail?

607
00:49:58,634 --> 00:49:59,654
You never fail.

608
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:24,463
Are you ready for our dance?

609
00:50:33,665 --> 00:50:36,454
Is it him?  Is that the first son of Odin?

610
00:50:38,072 --> 00:50:39,301
Heimdall, your eyes!?

611
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:41,672
Oh, they see everything.

612
00:50:42,107 --> 00:50:44,216
They see you leading us to Hel.

613
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:46,211
Wake up!

614
00:50:49,585 --> 00:50:53,038
The war's over, Steve.  We can go home!

615
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,520
Imagine it!

616
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:10,113
- I can still save you.
- We are all dead.  Can you not see?

617
00:51:15,082 --> 00:51:16,682
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

618
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:22,895
See where your power leads.

619
00:51:33,729 --> 00:51:34,729
Sloppy.

620
00:51:35,862 --> 00:51:37,155
Pretending to fail.

621
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:40,468
The ceremony is necessary,

622
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:44,521
for you to take your place in the world.

623
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,866
- I have no place in the world.
- Exactly.

624
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:54,214
- Incredible.
- Ah, it hurts.

625
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,796
- Thank you.
- I'll be right back.
- No.

626
00:51:57,852 --> 00:52:00,417
I'm over it.  I want...

627
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:05,391
I want to finish the plan.

628
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:07,819
I want the big one.

629
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:21,624
Half of the Vibranium's getting away.

630
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:23,282
And you're not going anywhere.

631
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:26,999
Of course not.  I'm already there.  You'll catch on.

632
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:30,212
But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

633
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:46,672
News or footage, keyword: Hulk.

634
00:52:50,956 --> 00:52:53,305
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

635
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:55,413
Well, that's not gonna happen.  Not for a while.

636
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:58,074
The whole team is down.

637
00:52:59,246 --> 00:53:00,246
You got no back up here.

638
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:02,447
I'm calling in VERONICA.

639
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:14,948
Hey!  Need backup!

640
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,050
Raaar!

641
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:37,450
All right everybody, stand down!

642
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:48,065
You listening?  That little witch is messing with your mind.

643
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:50,619
You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.

644
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:52,057
Raaaar!

645
00:54:52,057 --> 00:54:55,254
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

646
00:54:59,268 --> 00:55:00,268
Okay.

647
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,767
In the back?  Dick move, Banner.

648
00:55:36,338 --> 00:55:37,903
VERONICA, gimme a hand.

649
00:56:04,847 --> 00:56:08,316
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!

650
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:18,336
Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

651
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:21,752
Not that way, not that way!

652
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:32,356
C'mon!  Bruce, you gotta work with me!

653
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,680
Everybody out!

654
00:56:52,978 --> 00:56:53,978
Somebody owie! [?]

655
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:04,588
I'm sorry.

656
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:22,506
- Damage report.
- (bzzzt).
- It's comprehensive.

657
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:23,931
Show me something.

658
00:57:34,624 --> 00:57:37,073
How quickly can we buy this building?

659
00:58:08,893 --> 00:58:10,458
Go, move, move, move, move!

660
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:20,963
Raar!  Raaaar!

661
00:59:04,944 --> 00:59:08,705
The news is loving you guys.  Nobody else is.

662
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:14,581
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.

663
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:16,254
Stark Relief Foundation?

664
00:59:16,494 --> 00:59:17,823
Already on the scene.

665
00:59:17,893 --> 00:59:21,893
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...we took the hit.

666
00:59:22,564 --> 00:59:25,693
- We'll shake it off.
- Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode.

667
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:27,965
And stay away from here.

668
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,756
So, run and hide?

669
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:34,989
Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.

670
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,110
Neither do we.

671
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:45,682
Hey, you wanna switch out?

672
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:47,383
No, I'm good.

673
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,066
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, 'cause there's still a few hours out.

674
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:53,658
Few hours from...where?

675
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,860
A safehouse.

676
01:00:21,488 --> 01:00:24,005
- What is this place?
- A safehouse.

677
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,159
Let's hope.

678
01:00:31,613 --> 01:00:34,201
Honey.  I'm home.

679
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:38,304
Hi.

680
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:40,372
Company.  Sorry didn't call ahead.

681
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:44,383
This is an agent of some kind.

682
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,141
Gentleman, this is Laura.

683
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:48,741
I know all your names.

684
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:53,005
Oooh, incoming.

685
01:00:53,755 --> 01:00:56,352
- Ah!
- Dad!
- I see her!  Hey buddy!

686
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:57,914
How you guys doing?

687
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:00,929
These are...smaller agents.

688
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,689
- Oh my goodness!
- Did you bring Auntie Nat?

689
01:01:04,866 --> 01:01:07,247
Why don't you hug her and find out?

690
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:13,815
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we woulda called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

691
01:01:13,874 --> 01:01:17,011
Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

692
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,718
I kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way.

693
01:01:20,882 --> 01:01:23,767
- I figure it's a good place to lay low.
- Honey.

694
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:27,548
I really missed you.  How's little Natasha, huh?

695
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:29,742
She is...

696
01:01:31,161 --> 01:01:32,161
...Nathaniel.

697
01:01:35,263 --> 01:01:36,263
Traitor.

698
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,060
(chatter)

699
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:47,305
- He's getting bigger, huh?
- (chatter)

700
01:01:51,976 --> 01:01:52,976
Thor.

701
01:01:52,713 --> 01:01:57,611
I saw something in that dream.  I need answers.  I won't find them here.

702
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:09,451
We can go home.

703
01:02:20,906 --> 01:02:25,668
See you worried for nothing.  Can't even feel the difference, can you?

704
01:02:27,612 --> 01:02:31,370
If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up.

705
01:02:31,752 --> 01:02:34,609
Heh heh heh.  Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

706
01:02:37,522 --> 01:02:41,831
What about Nat, and Dr. Banner?  How long has that been going on?

707
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:43,893
Has what?

708
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:46,567
Ha ha ha!  You are so cute.

709
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:48,222
Nat and...Banner?

710
01:02:49,204 --> 01:02:52,029
I'll explain when you're older.  "Hawkeye."

711
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,069
Oh.  Okay.

712
01:02:55,406 --> 01:02:58,263
It's bad, right?  Nat seems really shaken.

713
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:03,995
Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really.

714
01:03:07,219 --> 01:03:10,824
They carry a big damn stick.  Nat took a serious hit.

715
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:14,806
Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.

716
01:03:14,895 --> 01:03:16,495
That someone'd be you.

717
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:22,216
You know I totally support your Avenging.  I couldn't be prouder.

718
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:27,386
But I see those guys, those..."gods,"

719
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,879
You don't think they need me.

720
01:03:32,287 --> 01:03:33,375
I think they do.

721
01:03:34,012 --> 01:03:35,577
Which is a lot scarier.

722
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:38,236
They're a mess.

723
01:03:40,118 --> 01:03:41,118
Yeah.

724
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:43,084
I guess they're my mess.

725
01:03:44,565 --> 01:03:50,335
You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back.

726
01:03:54,369 --> 01:03:55,369
Things are changing for us.

727
01:03:56,934 --> 01:04:01,367
In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

728
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,339
I need...

729
01:04:06,916 --> 01:04:07,916
Just be sure.

730
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:10,847
Yes, ma'am.

731
01:04:19,853 --> 01:04:21,622
I can feel the difference.

732
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:29,621
(speaking Korean)

733
01:04:35,106 --> 01:04:37,487
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

734
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:43,013
I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.  I didn't.

735
01:04:43,049 --> 01:04:44,358
Do you expect a thank you note?

736
01:04:44,617 --> 01:04:46,318
I expect you to know why.

737
01:04:48,476 --> 01:04:49,376
The cradle.

738
01:04:49,448 --> 01:04:51,557
"This is the next thing, Tony."

739
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:53,119
This...is the next me.

740
01:04:54,484 --> 01:04:59,110
The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.

741
01:04:59,133 --> 01:05:00,289
It can.  You can.

742
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,330
You lack the material.

743
01:05:04,512 --> 01:05:06,689
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

744
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,417
But we all have room to improve.

745
01:05:33,834 --> 01:05:36,351
Nat, didn't realize you were waiting.

746
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,581
I would've joined you, but uh,

747
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,247
didn't seem like the right time.

748
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:43,910
I used up all the hot water.

749
01:05:44,509 --> 01:05:46,074
I should've joined you.

750
01:05:46,544 --> 01:05:47,768
Missed our window.

751
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,680
Did we?

752
01:05:53,546 --> 01:05:55,111
The world saw the Hulk.

753
01:05:56,822 --> 01:05:59,135
The real Hulk, for the first time.

754
01:06:02,695 --> 01:06:03,896
You know I have to leave.

755
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,311
But you assume that I have to stay?

756
01:06:07,132 --> 01:06:11,418
I had this, um, dream.  The kind that seems normal at the time.

757
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:16,032
- But when you wake...
- What did you dream?

758
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:18,065
That I was an Avenger.

759
01:06:20,412 --> 01:06:24,222
That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.

760
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,907
I think you're being harder on yourself.

761
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:32,938
Here I was hoping that was your job.

762
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:37,262
What are you doing?

763
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:40,292
I'm running with it.

764
01:06:42,202 --> 01:06:43,202
With you.

765
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:48,891
If running's the plan, as far as you want.

766
01:06:51,477 --> 01:06:53,178
Are you out of your mind?

767
01:06:58,887 --> 01:07:00,868
I mean, understand that I'm...

768
01:07:00,877 --> 01:07:01,877
Natasha.

769
01:07:03,202 --> 01:07:04,222
Where can I go?

770
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:07,920
Where in the world am I not a threat?

771
01:07:07,953 --> 01:07:09,522
You're not a threat to me.

772
01:07:09,555 --> 01:07:10,555
You sure?

773
01:07:11,021 --> 01:07:15,522
Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me.

774
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:22,418
I can't ever...I can't have this, kids,

775
01:07:23,334 --> 01:07:26,034
do the math, I physically can't.

776
01:07:27,469 --> 01:07:28,469
Neither can I.

777
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:39,660
In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um,

778
01:07:41,218 --> 01:07:43,395
they have a graduation ceremony.

779
01:07:45,856 --> 01:07:47,149
They sterilize you.

780
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:51,451
It's efficient.

781
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,874
One less thing to worry about.

782
01:07:58,439 --> 01:08:01,976
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

783
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:05,798
Makes everything easier.

784
01:08:07,312 --> 01:08:08,312
Even killing.

785
01:08:13,816 --> 01:08:17,353
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

786
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:24,492
What, so we disappear?

787
01:08:31,234 --> 01:08:34,431
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

788
01:08:34,446 --> 01:08:37,439
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

789
01:08:37,612 --> 01:08:39,873
Was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception.

790
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:41,341
Yeah.  Give him time.

791
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:45,176
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

792
01:08:45,619 --> 01:08:49,419
"Earth's Mightiest Heroes."  Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

793
01:08:49,787 --> 01:08:52,168
Seems like you walked away alright.

794
01:08:53,924 --> 01:08:55,148
Is that a problem?

795
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,881
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

796
01:08:58,562 --> 01:09:00,059
Call me old fashioned.

797
01:09:00,099 --> 01:09:02,492
Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

798
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:05,470
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

799
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:08,734
Well I guess you'd know.  Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

800
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:11,020
- Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team.

801
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:14,076
That would end the team.  Isn't that the mission?

802
01:09:14,078 --> 01:09:19,316
Isn't that the "why we fight," so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?

803
01:09:20,386 --> 01:09:25,556
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die.

804
01:09:25,557 --> 01:09:26,557
Every time.

805
01:09:28,061 --> 01:09:34,061
Sorry.  Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.

806
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:38,642
- I thought you might...
- Yeah, I'll give it a kick.

807
01:09:41,305 --> 01:09:42,938
Don't take from my pile.

808
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:54,151
Hello, dear.

809
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:58,482
Tell me everything.

810
01:09:59,626 --> 01:10:00,626
What ails you?

811
01:10:01,662 --> 01:10:02,662
Do me a favor.

812
01:10:04,363 --> 01:10:06,268
Try not to bring it to life.

813
01:10:06,682 --> 01:10:08,927
Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx.

814
01:10:08,999 --> 01:10:11,284
I get it, Maria Hill called you right?

815
01:10:11,338 --> 01:10:12,883
Was she ever not working for you?

816
01:10:12,903 --> 01:10:14,536
Artificial Intelligence.

817
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:18,894
- You never even hesitated.
- Look, it's been a really long day,

818
01:10:18,977 --> 01:10:22,938
like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?

819
01:10:22,947 --> 01:10:25,597
Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

820
01:10:25,616 --> 01:10:28,474
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.

821
01:10:29,054 --> 01:10:30,347
I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.

822
01:10:35,762 --> 01:10:37,962
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

823
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:40,865
I saw it.

824
01:10:41,135 --> 01:10:43,352
I didn't tell the team.  How could I.

825
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,374
I saw them all dead, Nick.  Felt it.  The whole world, too.

826
01:10:48,241 --> 01:10:49,534
It's because of me.

827
01:10:50,574 --> 01:10:51,594
I wasn't ready.

828
01:10:52,812 --> 01:10:54,445
I didn't do all I could.

829
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:57,965
The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

830
01:10:58,113 --> 01:11:01,010
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

831
01:11:01,684 --> 01:11:04,005
It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

832
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:05,416
The end of the path I started us on.

833
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:11,351
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

834
01:11:11,437 --> 01:11:12,934
War isn't one of them.

835
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:21,093
Watching my friends die.  You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?

836
01:11:22,008 --> 01:11:23,008
Nope.

837
01:11:24,508 --> 01:11:26,005
Wasn't the worst part.

838
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,659
The worst part...is that you didn't.

839
01:11:35,855 --> 01:11:37,284
I'll see you tonight.

840
01:11:39,472 --> 01:11:40,560
I like the look.

841
01:11:41,868 --> 01:11:45,173
If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

842
01:11:45,197 --> 01:11:46,453
I need your help.

843
01:11:46,464 --> 01:11:47,729
It's nice to be needed.

844
01:11:47,797 --> 01:11:48,817
It's dangerous.

845
01:11:49,535 --> 01:11:51,780
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

846
01:11:54,572 --> 01:11:57,945
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.

847
01:11:58,012 --> 01:12:00,912
My contacts all say he's building something.

848
01:12:00,947 --> 01:12:05,217
The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.

849
01:12:05,285 --> 01:12:06,585
What about Ultron himself?

850
01:12:07,117 --> 01:12:12,707
Ah.  He's easy to track, he's everywhere.  Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

851
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:16,021
Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.

852
01:12:16,061 --> 01:12:17,674
- He still going after launch codes?
- Yes, he is,

853
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:19,461
but he's not making any headway.

854
01:12:19,696 --> 01:12:22,596
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

855
01:12:22,695 --> 01:12:25,695
Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.

856
01:12:25,696 --> 01:12:27,996
- NEXUS?
- It's the world internet hub in Oslo,

857
01:12:28,005 --> 01:12:31,405
every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.

858
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:32,770
So what'd they say?

859
01:12:32,877 --> 01:12:34,550
He's fixated on the missiles.

860
01:12:34,594 --> 01:12:36,819
But the codes are constantly being changed.

861
01:12:36,915 --> 01:12:37,915
By who?

862
01:12:39,252 --> 01:12:40,340
Parties unknown.

863
01:12:40,517 --> 01:12:41,405
We have an ally?

864
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,321
Ultron's got an enemy.  That's not the same thing.

865
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,287
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

866
01:12:46,506 --> 01:12:49,094
I might need to visit Oslo.  Find our unknown.

867
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:53,363
Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.

868
01:12:53,433 --> 01:12:55,457
I do.  I have you.

869
01:12:56,503 --> 01:12:59,559
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else.

870
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,320
You kids had all the tech you could dream of.

871
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:10,009
Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world.

872
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:15,549
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing between him and his mission.

873
01:13:15,722 --> 01:13:21,422
And whether or not he admits it, his mission is global destruction.

874
01:13:21,592 --> 01:13:23,892
All this, laid in a grave.

875
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:26,831
So stand.

876
01:13:28,232 --> 01:13:30,137
Outwit the platinum bastard.

877
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,678
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

878
01:13:32,707 --> 01:13:33,972
You know what, Romanoff?

879
01:13:34,405 --> 01:13:35,834
So what does he want?

880
01:13:37,343 --> 01:13:40,543
To become better.  Better than us.

881
01:13:40,944 --> 01:13:42,645
He keeps building bodies.

882
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:47,728
Person bodies.  The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

883
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:49,421
But he keeps coming back to it.

884
01:13:50,353 --> 01:13:53,623
When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.

885
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:57,327
They don't need to be protected.  They need to evolve.

886
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,732
- Ultron's going to evolve.
- How?

887
01:14:04,734 --> 01:14:07,591
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

888
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,420
It's beautiful.

889
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:18,033
The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them.

890
01:14:18,118 --> 01:14:19,695
And SHIELD never even thought...

891
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:24,417
The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a frisbee.

892
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:28,914
Typical of humans.  They scratch the surface and never think...

893
01:14:30,361 --> 01:14:31,585
...to look within.

894
01:14:42,408 --> 01:14:46,118
- I'll take Natasha and Clint.
- All right.  Strictly recon.

895
01:14:46,213 --> 01:14:47,213
I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.

896
01:14:47,781 --> 01:14:49,266
If Ultron is really building a body...

897
01:14:49,312 --> 01:14:52,409
He'll be more powerful than any of us.  Maybe all of us.

898
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,394
An android designed by a robot.

899
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:58,634
You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.

900
01:14:58,657 --> 01:15:02,102
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.  Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

901
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:04,917
She's all yours.  Apparently.  What are you gonna do?

902
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:08,290
I don't know.  Something dramatic, I hope.

903
01:15:11,936 --> 01:15:14,045
I'll finish with your flooring in the sunroom as soon as I get back.

904
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:18,625
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

905
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:19,812
No.

906
01:15:20,543 --> 01:15:22,040
It's the last project.

907
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:24,579
Promise.

908
01:15:43,069 --> 01:15:44,069
This is it.

909
01:15:45,872 --> 01:15:47,165
The Water of Sight.

910
01:15:50,308 --> 01:15:52,825
In every realm, there's a reflection.

911
01:15:54,013 --> 01:15:59,113
If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.

912
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:03,724
The men who enter that water, their legends don't end well.

913
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:08,364
The hacker's faster than Ultron, he could be anywhere.

914
01:16:08,392 --> 01:16:13,792
And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

915
01:16:15,164 --> 01:16:16,795
How do you find it?

916
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,245
Very simple.  You bring a magnet.

917
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:22,459
Oh, (sings) I'm protecting nuclear codes and you don't want me to.

918
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:27,798
Come and get me.

919
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:41,590
Wake up!

920
01:16:48,601 --> 01:16:49,601
Thor!

921
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,170
Extinction.

922
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,673
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

923
01:17:10,421 --> 01:17:13,921
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.

924
01:17:15,926 --> 01:17:16,946
I can read him.

925
01:17:18,163 --> 01:17:19,883
He is dreaming.

926
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:25,911
I wouldn't call it dreams.  It's Ultron's base consciousness.  Informational noise.  Soon...

927
01:17:25,938 --> 01:17:28,738
How soon?  I'm not being pushy.

928
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:35,174
We're imprinting a physical brain.  There are no shortcuts.  Even if you imagined...

929
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:36,447
Aaah!

930
01:17:40,086 --> 01:17:41,086
He...

931
01:17:44,154 --> 01:17:47,095
- How could you?
- How could I what?

932
01:17:47,172 --> 01:17:49,825
You said we would destroy the Avengers.

933
01:17:50,527 --> 01:17:53,520
- Make a better world.
- It will be better.

934
01:17:53,566 --> 01:17:55,566
- When everybody's dead.
- That is not...!

935
01:17:56,234 --> 01:17:59,907
The human race will have every opportunity to improve.

936
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:02,463
And if they don't?

937
01:18:02,475 --> 01:18:03,475
Ask Noah.

938
01:18:04,773 --> 01:18:05,861
You're a madman.

939
01:18:06,408 --> 01:18:12,530
There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

940
01:18:12,887 --> 01:18:19,477
When the earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up.

941
01:18:21,093 --> 01:18:23,117
We have to evolve.  There's no room.

942
01:18:24,661 --> 01:18:28,661
Weak.  Who decides who's weak?

943
01:18:29,049 --> 01:18:30,886
Life.  Life always decides.

944
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:40,059
There's incoming.  The Quinjet.  We have to move.

945
01:18:40,144 --> 01:18:41,573
That's not a problem.

946
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,079
Uh, wait, guys!  I...

947
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:57,307
They don't understand.  When they see, they'll understand.

948
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:00,939
I just need a little more...time.

949
01:19:12,476 --> 01:19:14,476
Two minutes.  Stay close.

950
01:19:21,584 --> 01:19:22,584
Dr. Cho!

951
01:19:26,592 --> 01:19:28,409
He's uploading himself into the body.

952
01:19:28,503 --> 01:19:29,503
Where?

953
01:19:31,064 --> 01:19:33,717
The real power is inside of the cradle.

954
01:19:34,099 --> 01:19:37,184
The gem.  It's power is uncontainable.

955
01:19:39,173 --> 01:19:40,942
You can't just blow it up.

956
01:19:42,537 --> 01:19:44,086
You have to get the cradle to Stark.

957
01:19:44,178 --> 01:19:45,811
First I have to find it.

958
01:19:45,842 --> 01:19:46,842
Go.

959
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:48,441
- Did you guys copy that?
- We did.

960
01:19:49,113 --> 01:19:55,491
I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest.  That could be him.

961
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,820
There.  It's the truck from the lab.  Right above you, Cap.

962
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:00,694
In the loop by the bridge.

963
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:04,535
It's them.  Got three with the cradle, one in the cab.

964
01:20:04,627 --> 01:20:06,432
I could take out the driver.

965
01:20:06,496 --> 01:20:09,178
Negative!  That truck crashes, the gem could level the city.

966
01:20:09,368 --> 01:20:10,368
We need to draw out Ultron.

967
01:20:20,613 --> 01:20:21,701
No, no no no no.

968
01:20:24,318 --> 01:20:25,338
Leave me alone!

969
01:20:33,794 --> 01:20:37,067
Well he's definitely unhappy!  I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

970
01:20:37,262 --> 01:20:39,439
You're not a match for him, Cap.

971
01:20:40,196 --> 01:20:41,216
Thanks, Barton.

972
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,267
You know what's in that cradle?

973
01:21:05,859 --> 01:21:09,600
The power to make real change.  And that terrifies you.

974
01:21:09,627 --> 01:21:11,668
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

975
01:21:14,364 --> 01:21:15,364
Stop!

976
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:30,333
We got a window.  4, 3...  Give 'em hell.

977
01:21:40,923 --> 01:21:43,440
I'm always picking up after you boys.

978
01:21:43,728 --> 01:21:46,433
They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.

979
01:21:46,433 --> 01:21:47,433
Which way?

980
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:48,601
One right...

981
01:21:49,592 --> 01:21:50,592
Now.

982
01:22:21,565 --> 01:22:23,185
Out of the way!  Coming through!

983
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:24,739
Sorry, coming through!

984
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:40,158
Come on!

985
01:22:41,494 --> 01:22:42,494
Clint!  Can you draw out the guards?

986
01:22:42,925 --> 01:22:43,945
We'll find out.

987
01:22:44,762 --> 01:22:45,762
Beep beep!

988
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:06,135
(Korean language)

989
01:23:23,132 --> 01:23:27,233
Heading back towards you.  Whatever you're going to do, do it now.

990
01:23:31,774 --> 01:23:34,359
I'm going in.  Cap, can you keep him occupied?

991
01:23:35,209 --> 01:23:37,522
What do you think I've been doing?

992
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:21,651
The package is airborne.

993
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,385
I have a clean shot.

994
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:26,548
- Negative.  I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you...

995
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,739
Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.

996
01:24:28,812 --> 01:24:30,549
How you want me to take it?

997
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:33,455
Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.

998
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,578
Please.  Don't do this.

999
01:24:47,418 --> 01:24:48,983
What choice do we have?

1000
01:24:57,003 --> 01:24:58,003
I'm off him!

1001
01:24:58,094 --> 01:24:59,894
He's heading your way!

1002
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:06,062
Nat, we gotta go.

1003
01:25:17,046 --> 01:25:18,446
- Clint!
- Nat!

1004
01:25:22,485 --> 01:25:23,641
Cap, you see Nat?

1005
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,549
If you have the package, get it to Stark!  Go!

1006
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,222
- Do you have eyes on Nat?
- Go!

1007
01:25:33,738 --> 01:25:34,738
Civilians in our path.

1008
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,530
Can you stop this thing?

1009
01:26:16,365 --> 01:26:18,865
I'm fine.  I just need to take a minute.

1010
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:21,124
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1011
01:26:21,314 --> 01:26:22,919
The cradle.  Did you get it?

1012
01:26:23,447 --> 01:26:25,148
Stark'll take care of it.

1013
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:27,749
No, he won't.

1014
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,101
You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.

1015
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:35,514
He will do anything to make things right.

1016
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:41,699
Stark, come in.

1017
01:26:42,136 --> 01:26:43,136
Stark.

1018
01:26:44,534 --> 01:26:45,622
Anyone on comms?

1019
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:51,004
Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it.

1020
01:26:51,408 --> 01:26:53,508
Where do you think he gets that?

1021
01:26:56,287 --> 01:26:57,087
Anything on Nat?

1022
01:26:57,178 --> 01:27:00,776
Haven't heard.  But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.

1023
01:27:00,784 --> 01:27:04,949
- This is sealed tight.
- We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.

1024
01:27:06,522 --> 01:27:10,476
Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?

1025
01:27:10,527 --> 01:27:12,636
- Doesn't the out sign cast.[?]
- Yeah.
- I'll find it.

1026
01:27:16,701 --> 01:27:21,939
I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

1027
01:27:22,338 --> 01:27:23,494
Yeah, about that.

1028
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:28,575
No.

1029
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,562
- You have to trust me.
- Kinda don't.

1030
01:27:30,648 --> 01:27:34,348
Our ally?  The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes?

1031
01:27:36,452 --> 01:27:37,452
I found him.

1032
01:27:38,053 --> 01:27:39,277
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1033
01:27:39,446 --> 01:27:46,793
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis 'cause he was angry.  He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.

1034
01:27:47,064 --> 01:27:52,642
So Jarvis went underground.  Okay, scattered, dumped his memory.  But not his protocols.

1035
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:56,341
He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.

1036
01:27:58,104 --> 01:28:04,304
So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?

1037
01:28:04,324 --> 01:28:08,148
No, of course not!  I want to help you put Jarvis into this thing.

1038
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:13,630
We're out of my field here.  You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1039
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:19,085
And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix can beat Ultron's?

1040
01:28:19,126 --> 01:28:21,314
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

1041
01:28:22,232 --> 01:28:28,932
This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1042
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:31,303
- We have to.
- I think it's worth a go.

1043
01:28:33,478 --> 01:28:37,964
No.  I'm in a loop.  I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.

1044
01:28:37,977 --> 01:28:40,777
I know, I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it.

1045
01:28:42,485 --> 01:28:49,391
We're mad scientists.  We're monsters, buddy.  You gotta own it.  Make a stand.

1046
01:28:54,428 --> 01:28:58,052
It's not a loop.  It's the end of the line.

1047
01:29:19,358 --> 01:29:23,858
I wasn't sure you'd wake up.  I hoped you would, I wanted to show you.

1048
01:29:25,195 --> 01:29:27,696
I don't have anyone else.

1049
01:29:29,266 --> 01:29:32,935
I think a lot about the meteors.  The purity of them,

1050
01:29:33,739 --> 01:29:36,368
"boom!", the end, start again.

1051
01:29:36,772 --> 01:29:40,989
The world made clean for the new man to rebuild.

1052
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:43,603
I was meant to be new.

1053
01:29:44,049 --> 01:29:45,954
I was meant to be beautiful.

1054
01:29:47,995 --> 01:29:53,041
The world will never look the sky and see hope, see mercy.

1055
01:29:54,024 --> 01:29:57,357
Instead they'll look up in horror because of you.

1056
01:29:57,794 --> 01:30:01,195
You've wounded me.  I give you full marks for that

1057
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:05,897
But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me...

1058
01:30:10,607 --> 01:30:13,076
...just makes me stronger!"

1059
01:30:52,181 --> 01:30:54,222
This framwork is not compatible.

1060
01:30:54,316 --> 01:30:56,016
Genetic coding tower's at 97 percent.

1061
01:30:57,651 --> 01:31:02,205
You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.

1062
01:31:02,759 --> 01:31:04,392
I'm gonna say this once.

1063
01:31:04,461 --> 01:31:05,549
How about nonce?

1064
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:06,626
Shut it down.

1065
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:07,961
Nope.  Not gonna happen.

1066
01:31:07,997 --> 01:31:10,458
- You don't know what you're doing.
- And you do?  She's not in your head?

1067
01:31:11,467 --> 01:31:14,936
- I know you're angry.
- No, we're way past that.

1068
01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:17,952
I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

1069
01:31:17,994 --> 01:31:19,394
Banner, after everything that's happened...

1070
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:21,307
- That's nothing compared to what's coming.  It isn't a game.
- You don't know what's in there.  The creature...

1071
01:31:26,847 --> 01:31:30,048
No, no. No, no.  You were saying?

1072
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,160
Pietro!

1073
01:31:39,795 --> 01:31:42,108
What?  You didn't see that coming?

1074
01:31:44,469 --> 01:31:46,938
I'm re-routing the upload.

1075
01:31:51,843 --> 01:31:53,408
Go ahead.  Piss me off.

1076
01:32:05,722 --> 01:32:06,722
Hey!

1077
01:33:31,492 --> 01:33:32,492
I'm sorry.  That was...

1078
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:35,475
...odd.

1079
01:33:36,045 --> 01:33:37,045
Thank you.

1080
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,528
Thor.

1081
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:45,550
You helped create this?

1082
01:33:45,989 --> 01:33:52,179
I've had a vision.  A whirlpool that  sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that.

1083
01:33:52,429 --> 01:33:53,029
What, the gem?

1084
01:33:53,163 --> 01:33:59,563
It's the Mind Stone.  It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

1085
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,627
- Then why would you bring it...
- Because Stark is right.

1086
01:34:01,706 --> 01:34:04,019
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1087
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:06,521
- The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
- Not alone.

1088
01:34:07,612 --> 01:34:09,701
Why does your "vision" sound like Jarvis?

1089
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:13,974
We reconfigured Jarvis' matrix to create something new.

1090
01:34:14,485 --> 01:34:16,562
I think I've had my fill of new.

1091
01:34:16,587 --> 01:34:19,920
- You think I'm a child of Ultron.
- You're not?

1092
01:34:21,792 --> 01:34:28,512
I'm not Ultron.  I'm not Jarvis.  I am...

1093
01:34:28,561 --> 01:34:29,561
I am.

1094
01:34:32,034 --> 01:34:34,859
I looked in your head and saw annihilation.

1095
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:35,901
Look again.

1096
01:34:36,603 --> 01:34:39,232
Huh.  Your seal of approval means jack to me.

1097
01:34:39,371 --> 01:34:45,436
Their powers.  The horrors in our heads.  Ultron himself.  They all came from the Mind Stone, and nothing compared to what it can unleash.

1098
01:34:45,449 --> 01:34:46,449
But with it on our side...

1099
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,768
Is it?  Are you?

1100
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:51,684
On our side?

1101
01:34:53,456 --> 01:34:55,497
I don't think it's that simple.

1102
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:58,441
Well better get real simple real soon.

1103
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:04,493
I'm on the side of life.  Ultron isn't.  He will end it all.

1104
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:07,344
- What's he waiting for?
- You.

1105
01:35:08,604 --> 01:35:09,965
- Where?
- Sokovia.

1106
01:35:09,941 --> 01:35:11,506
He's got Nat there too.

1107
01:35:13,311 --> 01:35:15,148
If we're wrong about you...

1108
01:35:17,146 --> 01:35:18,646
...if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

1109
01:35:20,249 --> 01:35:22,105
What will you do?

1110
01:35:28,357 --> 01:35:33,498
I don't want to kill Ultron.  He's unique.  And he's in pain.

1111
01:35:36,082 --> 01:35:40,436
But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed.

1112
01:35:40,503 --> 01:35:45,403
Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the 'net, we have to act now.

1113
01:35:46,442 --> 01:35:50,091
And not one of us can do it without the others.

1114
01:35:52,582 --> 01:35:55,982
Maybe I am a monster.  I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1115
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:01,253
But not what you want.  And not what you intended.

1116
01:36:03,461 --> 01:36:04,954
So there may be no way to make you trust me.

1117
01:36:05,028 --> 01:36:06,252
But we need to go.

1118
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:22,742
Right.

1119
01:36:23,816 --> 01:36:24,816
Well done.

1120
01:36:26,813 --> 01:36:27,813
Three minutes.

1121
01:36:28,751 --> 01:36:29,975
Get what you need.

1122
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:47,461
Good evening, boss.

1123
01:36:52,108 --> 01:36:55,589
No way we all get through this.  If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

1124
01:36:56,512 --> 01:36:59,257
- It's gonna be blood on the floor.
- I got no plans tomorrow night.

1125
01:36:59,383 --> 01:37:03,213
I get first crack at the big guy.  Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1126
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:06,332
That's true, he hates you the most.

1127
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:15,558
Ultron knows we're coming.  Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1128
01:37:15,953 --> 01:37:20,307
And that's what we signed up for.  But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1129
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:24,838
So our priority is getting them out.

1130
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,633
You're under attack.  Clear the city, now.

1131
01:37:36,214 --> 01:37:37,507
Get off your asses.

1132
01:37:38,587 --> 01:37:43,469
All they want is to live their lives in peace.  And that's not going to happen today.

1133
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:48,445
But we can do our best to protect them.  And we can get the job done.

1134
01:37:51,466 --> 01:37:53,983
Find out what Ultron's been building.

1135
01:37:54,589 --> 01:37:55,745
We find Romanoff.

1136
01:37:57,172 --> 01:37:58,465
We clear the field.

1137
01:37:59,325 --> 01:38:01,298
We keep the fight between us.

1138
01:38:08,851 --> 01:38:13,124
Ultron thinks we're monsters.  And we're what's wrong with the world.

1139
01:38:13,956 --> 01:38:18,756
This isn't just about beating him.  It's about whether he's right.

1140
01:38:25,136 --> 01:38:27,960
Natasha!  Natasha!

1141
01:38:29,004 --> 01:38:30,004
Bruce?

1142
01:38:31,771 --> 01:38:32,771
You alright?

1143
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:33,708
Yeah.

1144
01:38:33,777 --> 01:38:35,670
We came to the city, it's about to light up.

1145
01:38:35,714 --> 01:38:37,347
Don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?

1146
01:38:38,211 --> 01:38:40,311
Yeah.  I did.

1147
01:38:46,492 --> 01:38:47,185
So what's our play?

1148
01:38:47,825 --> 01:38:50,425
- I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished.

1149
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:57,305
We get out with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians.  And you don't play.

1150
01:38:59,335 --> 01:39:00,559
Our fight is over.

1151
01:39:02,506 --> 01:39:03,935
So we just disappear?

1152
01:39:09,347 --> 01:39:10,347
Come on.

1153
01:39:14,923 --> 01:39:17,984
Your mind's[?] in the church, boss.  I think he's waiting there for you.[?]

1154
01:39:23,527 --> 01:39:25,296
Come to confess your sins?

1155
01:39:25,928 --> 01:39:27,541
I don't know, how much time you got?

1156
01:39:27,542 --> 01:39:28,942
More than you.

1157
01:39:29,665 --> 01:39:32,965
Uhhh.  Have you been juicing?  On a Vibranium cocktail?

1158
01:39:33,934 --> 01:39:36,327
You're looking...I don't wanna say, puffy...

1159
01:39:36,402 --> 01:39:37,490
You're stalling to protect the people.

1160
01:39:38,421 --> 01:39:41,346
Well, that is the mission.  Did you forget?

1161
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:45,019
I've moved beyond your mission.  I'm free.

1162
01:39:50,616 --> 01:39:53,269
You think you're the only one stalling?

1163
01:39:54,087 --> 01:39:57,100
There's the rest of the Vibranium.  Function: still unclear.

1164
01:39:57,228 --> 01:39:58,997
This is how you end, Tony.

1165
01:39:59,664 --> 01:40:01,365
This is peace in my time.

1166
01:40:18,133 --> 01:40:19,133
Go!

1167
01:40:24,055 --> 01:40:25,055
Get off the street!

1168
01:40:30,194 --> 01:40:31,194
Back!

1169
01:40:32,927 --> 01:40:33,927
Ultron!

1170
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:43,871
My Vision.  They really did take everything from me.

1171
01:40:44,339 --> 01:40:48,080
- You set the terms, you can change them.
- All right.

1172
01:40:49,777 --> 01:40:50,777
Ahhh!

1173
01:41:11,567 --> 01:41:12,928
FRIDAY!  The Vision?

1174
01:41:12,968 --> 01:41:17,578
Boss, it's working.  He's burning Ultron out of the 'net, he won't escape through there.

1175
01:41:21,210 --> 01:41:22,298
You shut me out!

1176
01:41:23,612 --> 01:41:24,768
You think I care?

1177
01:41:26,695 --> 01:41:29,552
You take away my world, I take away yours.

1178
01:41:55,209 --> 01:41:56,209
(Sokovian)

1179
01:42:15,233 --> 01:42:17,954
- FRIDAY?
- Sokovia's going for a ride.

1180
01:42:30,614 --> 01:42:37,311
Do you see?  The beauty of it.  The inevitability.

1181
01:42:37,488 --> 01:42:40,953
You rise, only to fall.

1182
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:51,619
You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure.

1183
01:42:54,436 --> 01:42:58,450
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.

1184
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,996
It means nothing.

1185
01:43:00,417 --> 01:43:06,183
When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.

1186
01:43:11,052 --> 01:43:12,052
We gotta move.

1187
01:43:12,622 --> 01:43:13,831
You're not going to turn green?

1188
01:43:14,193 --> 01:43:17,126
I've got a compelling reason to not lose my cool.

1189
01:43:17,193 --> 01:43:18,193
I adore you.

1190
01:43:26,602 --> 01:43:28,303
But I need the other guy.

1191
01:43:33,675 --> 01:43:34,899
Let's finish the job.

1192
01:43:52,024 --> 01:43:55,269
- I really hope this makes us even.
- (grunt)

1193
01:43:55,565 --> 01:43:58,121
- Now go be a hero.
- Raaar!

1194
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,318
The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.

1195
01:44:10,348 --> 01:44:14,710
- If it drops?
- Right now the impact would kill thousands[?].  Once it gets high enough...

1196
01:44:14,711 --> 01:44:15,935
...global extinction.

1197
01:44:19,856 --> 01:44:22,169
That building's not clear, its tenth floor.

1198
01:44:27,181 --> 01:44:28,181
Hi.

1199
01:44:29,531 --> 01:44:31,428
Okay.  Get in the tub!

1200
01:44:38,674 --> 01:44:41,463
I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.

1201
01:44:42,653 --> 01:44:44,286
Cap, you got incoming.

1202
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:46,081
Incoming already came in.

1203
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:51,547
Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.

1204
01:44:51,822 --> 01:44:55,027
The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart.

1205
01:44:55,127 --> 01:45:00,545
You get hurt, you hurt 'em back.  You get killed, walk it off.

1206
01:45:41,903 --> 01:45:42,903
How can I defend them?

1207
01:45:43,872 --> 01:45:45,165
Hey, hey, you okay?

1208
01:45:45,607 --> 01:45:46,627
Oh, what the...

1209
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,428
Hey, look at me.

1210
01:45:47,497 --> 01:45:49,898
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares.

1211
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:51,341
Are you up for this?

1212
01:45:51,547 --> 01:45:52,547
Are you?

1213
01:45:53,328 --> 01:45:56,933
Look, I just need to know, 'cause the city i-, is flying.

1214
01:45:57,154 --> 01:46:02,772
Okay, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow.

1215
01:46:02,778 --> 01:46:04,479
None of this makes sense.

1216
01:46:06,962 --> 01:46:10,635
But I'm going back out there because of my job.  Okay?

1217
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,741
I can't do my job and babysit.

1218
01:46:13,233 --> 01:46:18,912
It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were.  If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.

1219
01:46:18,938 --> 01:46:24,611
Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door,

1220
01:46:25,113 --> 01:46:26,406
you are an Avenger.

1221
01:46:31,121 --> 01:46:32,550
All right, good chat.

1222
01:46:35,657 --> 01:46:37,358
Yeah, the city is flying.

1223
01:47:11,293 --> 01:47:12,293
I got you!

1224
01:47:13,197 --> 01:47:14,285
Just look at me.

1225
01:47:20,668 --> 01:47:22,301
You can't save them all.

1226
01:47:23,714 --> 01:47:24,734
You'll never...

1227
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:28,118
"You'll never" what?  You didn't finish!

1228
01:47:31,815 --> 01:47:33,380
What, were you napping?

1229
01:47:54,234 --> 01:47:55,834
Damn.  Thor!

1230
01:47:58,107 --> 01:47:59,536
You are bothering me.

1231
01:48:08,919 --> 01:48:09,919
Ow!

1232
01:48:11,488 --> 01:48:12,488
Uh...

1233
01:48:35,844 --> 01:48:39,621
- All right, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear!  We are very not clear!

1234
01:48:42,416 --> 01:48:44,117
All right, coming to you.

1235
01:48:44,288 --> 01:48:45,444
Keep up, old man.

1236
01:48:48,892 --> 01:48:50,116
Nobody would know.

1237
01:48:51,008 --> 01:48:52,008
Nobody.

1238
01:48:53,559 --> 01:49:00,346
Yeah, last I saw him, and Ultron was sitting on him, "what?," yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.  I miss him already.

1239
01:49:15,114 --> 01:49:16,934
Hold your fire!

1240
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:27,227
Romanoff!

1241
01:49:27,763 --> 01:49:28,763
Thanks.

1242
01:49:38,307 --> 01:49:43,804
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.  Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust.  The city's not coming down slow.

1243
01:49:43,844 --> 01:49:45,754
The spire's Vibranium.  If I get Thor to hit it...

1244
01:49:46,417 --> 01:49:49,317
It'll crack.  If that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.

1245
01:49:49,852 --> 01:49:53,058
What if we could cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.

1246
01:49:53,436 --> 01:49:55,409
That could vaporize the city.  And everyone on it.

1247
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,797
The next wave's gonna hit any minute.

1248
01:50:04,301 --> 01:50:06,002
What have you got, Stark?

1249
01:50:06,165 --> 01:50:09,838
Well, nothing great.  Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1250
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:12,562
That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.

1251
01:50:12,608 --> 01:50:15,433
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

1252
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:17,571
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1253
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:20,127
We're going to have to make a choice.

1254
01:50:20,351 --> 01:50:23,925
Cap, these people are going nowhere.  If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

1255
01:50:24,686 --> 01:50:25,987
Not 'til everyone's safe.

1256
01:50:25,987 --> 01:50:28,787
Everyone up here versus everyone down there?  There's no math there.

1257
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:30,790
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1258
01:50:31,094 --> 01:50:33,067
I didn't say we should leave.

1259
01:50:34,759 --> 01:50:36,392
There's worse ways to go.

1260
01:50:41,572 --> 01:50:44,497
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

1261
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:50,491
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.  It's about to get better.

1262
01:51:13,802 --> 01:51:20,055
Nice, right?  Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.  She's dusty, but she'll do.

1263
01:51:20,072 --> 01:51:21,673
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1264
01:51:21,673 --> 01:51:24,134
Oooh!  You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1265
01:51:24,414 --> 01:51:26,391
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1266
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:32,880
Lifeboats secure to deploy.  Disengage in 3, 2...  Take 'em out.

1267
01:51:42,129 --> 01:51:43,149
This is SHIELD?

1268
01:51:44,231 --> 01:51:46,748
This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.

1269
01:51:48,571 --> 01:51:49,864
This is not so bad.

1270
01:51:53,241 --> 01:51:54,241
Load 'em up.

1271
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:03,166
Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

1272
01:52:03,562 --> 01:52:04,991
Show 'em what we got.

1273
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:06,385
You're up.

1274
01:52:12,027 --> 01:52:14,748
Yes!  Now this is gonna be a good story.

1275
01:52:17,634 --> 01:52:19,607
Yup.  If you live to tell it.

1276
01:52:19,936 --> 01:52:21,877
You think I can't hold my own?

1277
01:52:21,950 --> 01:52:24,071
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1278
01:52:24,107 --> 01:52:25,808
You had to make it weird.

1279
01:52:29,747 --> 01:52:31,547
- Hurry!
- (chatter)

1280
01:52:49,868 --> 01:52:51,297
Here we go, here we go, let's move.

1281
01:52:55,528 --> 01:53:02,263
Number six boat is topped and locked.  Or, uh, or stocked, topped, it...it's uh, full of people.

1282
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:04,910
Incoming!

1283
01:53:07,724 --> 01:53:08,724
Oh, God!

1284
01:53:19,594 --> 01:53:21,091
You think you're saving anyone?

1285
01:53:22,695 --> 01:53:28,283
I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead.  Even you can't stop that.

1286
01:53:28,503 --> 01:53:37,202
I am Thor, son of Odin, as long as there is life in my breast, I am running out of things to say!  Are you ready?

1287
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:45,825
It's terribly well balanced.

1288
01:53:45,873 --> 01:53:50,091
Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.

1289
01:53:50,404 --> 01:53:53,125
I got it!  Create a heat seal.  I can...

1290
01:53:54,686 --> 01:53:58,836
- I can supercharge the spire from below.
- Running numbers.

1291
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:11,531
- I think it could work with enough power.
- Thor, I got a plan!

1292
01:54:11,579 --> 01:54:14,444
We're out of time.  They're coming for the core.

1293
01:54:14,449 --> 01:54:16,982
- Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
- On it.

1294
01:54:17,162 --> 01:54:19,611
Avengers, time to work for a living.

1295
01:54:28,531 --> 01:54:30,031
- You good?
- Yeah.

1296
01:54:30,753 --> 01:54:31,753
Romanoff?

1297
01:54:32,235 --> 01:54:34,976
You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini.

1298
01:54:35,238 --> 01:54:36,238
Relax, shellhead, not all of us can fly.

1299
01:54:43,378 --> 01:54:45,467
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1300
01:54:45,548 --> 01:54:47,148
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

1301
01:54:52,119 --> 01:54:53,519
That the best you can do?

1302
01:55:03,566 --> 01:55:04,586
You had to ask.

1303
01:55:05,398 --> 01:55:07,167
This is the best I can do.

1304
01:55:08,236 --> 01:55:12,386
This is exactly what I wanted.  All of you against all of me.

1305
01:55:13,409 --> 01:55:15,926
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1306
01:55:17,276 --> 01:55:20,621
Like the old man said.  Together.

1307
01:55:20,982 --> 01:55:22,582
Raaarrrr!!!

1308
01:56:48,138 --> 01:56:51,738
Uhh!  You know, with the benefit of hindsight....

1309
01:56:56,334 --> 01:56:57,334
Rarrrr!

1310
01:57:01,018 --> 01:57:02,759
They'll try to leave the city.

1311
01:57:02,785 --> 01:57:04,694
We can't let 'em, not even one.  Rhodey!

1312
01:57:04,712 --> 01:57:07,212
On it.  Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.

1313
01:57:07,889 --> 01:57:09,658
War Machine, comin' at ya!  Right?

1314
01:57:16,426 --> 01:57:17,426
Okay, what?

1315
01:57:17,731 --> 01:57:21,355
We gotta move out.  Even I can tell the air is getting thin.  You guys get to the boats...

1316
01:57:21,424 --> 01:57:23,424
I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.

1317
01:57:23,536 --> 01:57:24,797
What about the core?

1318
01:57:25,106 --> 01:57:29,394
I'll protect it.  It's my job.

1319
01:57:30,278 --> 01:57:31,278
Nat.

1320
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:40,570
- Get the people on the boats.
- I'm not going to leave you.
- I can handle these.

1321
01:57:42,421 --> 01:57:44,646
Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.

1322
01:57:44,658 --> 01:57:46,178
- Mmm.
- You understand?

1323
01:57:48,226 --> 01:57:50,347
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1324
01:57:50,623 --> 01:57:51,623
Heh. Go.

1325
01:57:53,266 --> 01:57:59,456
- Boss, power levels are way below...
- Leave out everything.  We've got one shot at this.

1326
01:58:01,508 --> 01:58:04,161
I know what I need to do.  Dining room!

1327
01:58:04,846 --> 01:58:09,812
If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice floor space for Laura, huh.

1328
01:58:09,898 --> 01:58:12,559
Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?

1329
01:58:12,706 --> 01:58:14,791
Kids always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1330
01:58:14,888 --> 01:58:16,861
Nobody eats in a dining room.

1331
01:58:19,326 --> 01:58:20,326
Raarrrr!

1332
01:58:21,563 --> 01:58:23,468
We don't have a lot of time.

1333
01:58:23,496 --> 01:58:25,265
So get your ass on a boat.

1334
01:58:37,981 --> 01:58:38,981
Hey big guy.

1335
01:58:41,184 --> 01:58:42,749
Sun's getting real low.

1336
01:58:43,759 --> 01:58:47,208
(chatter)  It'll be okay.  (chatter)

1337
01:58:52,826 --> 01:58:53,826
(Sokovian)

1338
01:58:54,595 --> 01:58:57,388
Kostya?

1339
01:59:09,979 --> 01:59:12,172
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

1340
01:59:12,213 --> 01:59:13,914
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1341
01:59:14,317 --> 01:59:15,317
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1342
01:59:15,348 --> 01:59:20,413
- Y'know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
- Maybe not.

1343
01:59:39,475 --> 01:59:45,221
I have no strings, so I have fun.  I'm not tied up to anyone.

1344
02:00:21,224 --> 02:00:22,925
You didn't see that coming.

1345
02:01:19,171 --> 02:01:20,668
Oh, for god's sake...!

1346
02:01:51,238 --> 02:01:52,462
No, no.  I'm fine.

1347
02:01:55,745 --> 02:01:57,174
It's been a long day.

1348
02:02:12,295 --> 02:02:13,295
Wanda.

1349
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:16,273
If you stay here, you'll die.

1350
02:02:18,599 --> 02:02:19,599
I just did.

1351
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:22,299
Do you know how it felt?

1352
02:02:36,847 --> 02:02:38,071
It felt like that.

1353
02:03:13,758 --> 02:03:15,214
Thor, on my mark.

1354
02:03:31,071 --> 02:03:32,071
Now!

1355
02:03:59,451 --> 02:04:00,451
Hey big guy.

1356
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:02,670
We did it.

1357
02:04:03,135 --> 02:04:04,496
The job's finished.

1358
02:04:05,372 --> 02:04:08,172
Now I need you to turn this boat around, okay?

1359
02:04:12,548 --> 02:04:17,117
We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out.

1360
02:04:18,049 --> 02:04:19,069
I need you t...

1361
02:04:50,788 --> 02:04:51,788
Oh, dear.

1362
02:05:03,896 --> 02:05:04,896
You're afraid.

1363
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:08,730
- Of you?
- Of death.

1364
02:05:09,370 --> 02:05:10,731
You're the last one.

1365
02:05:11,764 --> 02:05:14,213
You were supposed to be the last.

1366
02:05:14,238 --> 02:05:18,239
Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.

1367
02:05:19,378 --> 02:05:21,895
I suppose we're both disappointments.

1368
02:05:21,947 --> 02:05:25,147
Ha ha ha ha.  I suppose we are.

1369
02:05:26,088 --> 02:05:27,188
Humans are odd.

1370
02:05:29,287 --> 02:05:32,892
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and

1371
02:05:34,625 --> 02:05:36,598
try to control what won't be.

1372
02:05:37,632 --> 02:05:40,149
But there is grace in their failings.

1373
02:05:40,519 --> 02:05:42,152
I think you missed that.

1374
02:05:43,135 --> 02:05:44,155
They're doomed.

1375
02:05:45,239 --> 02:05:46,239
Yes.

1376
02:05:49,942 --> 02:05:53,147
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1377
02:05:55,199 --> 02:05:57,512
It's a privilege to be among them.

1378
02:05:57,849 --> 02:05:59,482
You're unbearably naive.

1379
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:01,758
Well,

1380
02:06:03,422 --> 02:06:04,851
I was born yesterday.

1381
02:07:00,254 --> 02:07:01,254
(chatter)

1382
02:07:18,336 --> 02:07:19,765
Say hi to Auntie Nat.

1383
02:07:21,333 --> 02:07:22,333
Sad.

1384
02:07:23,607 --> 02:07:28,097
One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea,

1385
02:07:30,144 --> 02:07:36,066
could be the Quinjet.  But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.

1386
02:07:36,083 --> 02:07:37,083
Right.

1387
02:07:38,284 --> 02:07:40,733
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1388
02:07:41,422 --> 02:07:42,919
He'll send a postcard.

1389
02:07:43,858 --> 02:07:45,151
Wish you were here.

1390
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:50,287
You sent me to recruit him, way back when.

1391
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:54,655
Did you know then what was going to happen?

1392
02:07:57,073 --> 02:08:01,903
You never know.  You hope for the best.  And make do with what you get.

1393
02:08:03,509 --> 02:08:04,802
I got a great team.

1394
02:08:05,846 --> 02:08:07,343
Nothing lasts forever.

1395
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:13,958
Trouble.  Ms. Romanoff.  No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes 'round.

1396
02:08:18,323 --> 02:08:20,469
The rules have changed.  We're dealing with something new.

1397
02:08:20,561 --> 02:08:23,617
- Well the Vision's artificial intelligence.
- A machine.

1398
02:08:24,097 --> 02:08:26,899
- So it doesn't count.
- No.  It's not, like, a person lifting the hammer.

1399
02:08:26,997 --> 02:08:29,597
- Right.  Different rules for us.
- Nice guy.  But artificial.
- Thank you.

1400
02:08:30,271 --> 02:08:33,408
He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.

1401
02:08:33,439 --> 02:08:35,208
It's safe with the Vision.

1402
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:38,162
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1403
02:08:40,483 --> 02:08:44,646
- But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
- It will still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1404
02:08:44,686 --> 02:08:45,971
I'm going to miss these talks of ours.

1405
02:08:46,051 --> 02:08:47,616
Not if you don't leave.

1406
02:08:47,854 --> 02:08:49,010
I have no choice.

1407
02:08:49,753 --> 02:08:55,936
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years.  It's not a coincidence.

1408
02:08:56,632 --> 02:08:59,532
Someone has been playing intricate games and made pawns of us.

1409
02:08:59,730 --> 02:09:03,187
- Once all these pieces are in position...
- Triple Yahtzee?

1410
02:09:03,238 --> 02:09:04,927
You think you can find out what's coming?

1411
02:09:04,974 --> 02:09:05,974
I do.

1412
02:09:06,808 --> 02:09:10,754
Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.

1413
02:09:18,378 --> 02:09:21,371
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1414
02:09:23,758 --> 02:09:25,295
I'm gonna miss him though.

1415
02:09:25,394 --> 02:09:29,884
And you're gonna miss me.  There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1416
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:31,427
I will miss you, Tony.

1417
02:09:32,233 --> 02:09:35,022
Yeah?  Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1418
02:09:36,537 --> 02:09:42,204
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm.  Hope nobody blows it up.

1419
02:09:42,274 --> 02:09:43,162
The simple life.

1420
02:09:43,208 --> 02:09:44,364
You'll get there one day.

1421
02:09:45,047 --> 02:09:53,147
I don't know.  Family, stability.  The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.

1422
02:09:54,457 --> 02:09:56,498
I think someone else came out.

1423
02:10:00,661 --> 02:10:01,661
You alright?

1424
02:10:03,162 --> 02:10:04,162
I'm home.

1425
02:10:13,309 --> 02:10:15,222
Want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work?

1426
02:10:15,278 --> 02:10:17,931
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1427
02:10:17,979 --> 02:10:21,797
Thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1428
02:10:21,835 --> 02:10:22,455
How do we look?

1429
02:10:22,483 --> 02:10:25,271
- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
- And that's what matters.

1430
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:30,740
- They're good.  They're not a team.
- Let's beat 'em into shape.

1431
02:10:48,971 --> 02:10:50,771
Avengers...!

1432
02:10:50,985 --> 02:10:55,078
SPOILER COMING UP -

1433
02:10:55,122 --> 02:10:59,215
MID-CREDIT STINGER SCENE (missing from this video) -

1434
02:10:59,558 --> 02:11:04,456
A gold glove is show stored inside a vault; the door to the vault opens.

1435
02:11:04,926 --> 02:11:09,688
Thanos puts his left hand into the gauntlet and raises it with a fist.

1436
02:11:10,202 --> 02:11:14,751
He says, "Fine.  I'll do it myself."

1437
02:11:14,974 --> 02:11:21,981
The gauntlet has 6 empty spaces (5 knuckles & 1 back of the hand), presumably for gems to placed in future movies.
