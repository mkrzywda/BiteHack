<i>The river... It's noisy.</i>

Why did't you let her come?

77
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:56,154
Do you blame her...
for what happened?

78
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,561
Don't...

79
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:17,128
Because she blames herself.

80
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:50,177
It's no one's fault...

81
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,894
You still love her, right?

82
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,335
Of course I do.

83
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,255
You should tell her.

00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,383
You are safe.

90
00:57:41,682 --> 00:57:43,668
They can't hear us.

91
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:48,238
It worked?

92
00:57:49,878 --> 00:57:52,448
You just need to rest now.

93
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:03,915
Where are they?

94
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,560
Where are they?

95
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,690
I'll find them.

96
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:15,616
She was with me...

97
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:19,610
She was with me and then I had
to go down to laundry.

98
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:23,186
He was with you, wasn't he?

99
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:24,995
Rockets.

100
00:58:28,452 --> 00:58:31,184
- He'll still be there?
- Surely.

101
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:35,372
He knows he should wait for you.
And she is...

102
00:58:35,373 --> 00:58:38,566
She is smart...
You will find the place...

103
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,867
They know what to do.

104
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:01,628
It's a boy.

105
00:59:03,383 --> 00:59:05,235
It's a boy.

106
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:11,361
I couldn't carred him.

107
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,105
He was heavy, isn't he?

108
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:32,511
Still... I can feel his
weight in my arms...

109
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:38,310
Small, but... So heavy...

110
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:49,268
And my hands were free...

111
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:56,183
I was carrying the bag...
But my hands were free.

112
00:59:56,184 --> 00:59:58,516
You have to stop.

113

I'm sorry, I couldn't carred...

114
01:00:05,614 --> 01:00:08,140
I should have carred.

115
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:16,429
Who are we?

116
01:00:17,953 --> 01:00:20,480
We can't protect them.
