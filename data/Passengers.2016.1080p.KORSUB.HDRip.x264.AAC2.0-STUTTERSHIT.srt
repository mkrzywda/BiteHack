JAMES PRESTON
DENVER, COLORADO
RATE 2 MECHANICAL ENGINEER

18
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,494
Good Morning, James!

19
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,098
How're you feeling?

20
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:33,432
Wait, what?

21
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:36,181
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

22
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:40,009
You've just spent a 120 years
in suspended animation.

23
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,731
What?

24
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:43,668
It's okay, James.

25
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:44,804
It's Jim.

26
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:46,214
Jim.

27
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:48,285
Just breathe.

28
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,802
Everything is okay.

29
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:50,957
Where am I?

30
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:53,160
You're a passenger on the Starship Avalon.

31
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:56,974
The Homestead Company's
premier interstellar star liner.

32
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:01,943
We've nearly completed the voyage
from Earth to your new home,

33
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,862
the colony world of Homestead II.

34
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:06,386
A new world.

35
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:07,895
A fresh start.

36
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,725
Room to grow.

37
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,097
Oh, yeah.

38
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:13,255
The Avalon is on final approach.

39
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,620
For the next 4 months,
you'll enjoy space travel

40
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,892
at it's most luxurious.

41
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,584
Food. Fun.
Friends.

42
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:21,778
My friends.

43
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:23,292
That's right, Jim.

44
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:27,571
The I.D. band on your wrist is your key
to the wonders of the Avalon.

45
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,959
You're in perfect health, Jim.

46
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:34,128
Let's get you to your cabin
where you can get some rest.

47
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:45,423
You maybe experiencing post-hibernation sickness.

48
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,052
Your door will illuminate for you.

49
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:53,545
Welcome to your cabin.

50
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,930
Your home until we make landfall.

51
00:05:55,955 --> 00:06:00,342
Over the next 4 months, you'll prepare
for your new life on Homestead II.

52
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,459
Meet you fellow passengers,
take skill building classes

53
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:05,859
and learn about colonial living.

54
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:08,479
You've been assigned to Learning group 38,

55
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:11,852
for passengers with engineering
and technical trade skills.

56
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:14,952
Please scan your I.D.
to confirm luggage delivery.

57
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:20,440
Jim, please scan your I.D.
to confirm luggage delivery.

58
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:29,438
To help you recover from hibernation,
be sure to drink plenty of fluids.

59
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,560
Enjoy the rest of your voyage
on the Avalon,

60
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:36,405
a Homestead Company Starship.

61
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:39,645
Good morning one and all.

62
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,470
It's a beautiful morning
here on the Starship Avalon.

63
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:45,235
Whatever you do don't get homesick,
get Homestead.

64
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,441
Let start things off with
one of my favorite back on Earth.

65
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,830
Just call me... call me Jim.
You got a cool jacket.

66
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,835
Hello, Passengers.

67
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,769
Will you all
please take a seat.

68
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,959
Welcome, Learning group 38.

69
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,306
Your introduction to colonial life.

70
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:35,570
Earth is a prosperous planet.

71
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,746
The cradle of civilization.

72
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:43,313
But for many, it's also overpopulated.
Over-priced. Overrated.

73
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,934
I'm sorry,
I think I maybe in the wrong...

74
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,779
- Hold all questions till the end, please.
- Oh, sorry.

75
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:50,396
The Colonies offer an alternative.

76
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:52,187
- A better way of life.
- Where are all the other...

77
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:56,610
And there's no colony
more beautiful than Homestead II,

78
00:07:56,635 --> 00:08:00,060
- the Jewel of the Occupied Worlds.
- I'm sorry.

79
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:01,846
Where IS everybody?

80
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:03,959
We're all on the Starship Avalon.

81
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,338
But I'm the only one here.

82
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:10,019
There are 5,000 passengers
and 258 crew members.

83
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:11,789
So why am I alone?

84
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:14,302
We're all in this together.

85
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,619
Hello?

86
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,560
Anybody here?

87
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:22,148
Hello?

88
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:35,993
Please buckle up and
secure any loose items.

89
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:40,199
This elevator will experience
a momentary lapse in gravity.

90
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,817
Grand Concourse.

91
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:23,515
Welcome to the Grand Concourse
aboard the Avalon, can I help you?

92
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,044
I need to talk to a person.

93
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,650
A real live person, please.

94
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:30,682
What sort of person? Personal trainer?
Travel planner? Therapist?

95
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:33,101
I don't know.
Somebody in charge.

96
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:37,272
The Ship Steward handles passenger affairs.
It's on level 3 of the Grand Concourse.

97
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:39,377
- Thank you.
- Happy to help!

98
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:46,046
Not good.

99
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,577
- Hello!
- Who's flying the ship?

100
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:50,046
The flight crew, the Captain,
the Pilot, the Chief Navigator...

101
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:51,596
I want to speak to the Captain.

102
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,383
The Captain rarely handles
passenger queries directly.

103
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:56,095
It's an emergency, please.

104
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,544
The Captain is usually found on the
Bridge, in the Command Ring.

105
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:13,172
Bridge access requires special authorization.

106
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:18,608
Bridge access requires special authorization.

107
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,660
You got to be kidding me.

108
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,920
Welcome to the Observatory.

109
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,435
What can I show you?

110
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:45,483
We're supposed to land soon,

111
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,005
I'm... I'm the only one awake.

112
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,637
I don't understand.
What can I show you?

113
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,591
Show me Homestead II.

114
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:59,998
Homestead II is the 4th planet
in the Bhakti system.

115
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,165
Right.
And where are we?

116
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:05,357
We're in transit
from Earth to Homestead II.

117
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:08,862
- We will arrive in approximately 90 years.
- What?

118
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:13,199
We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, 3 weeks and 1 day.

119
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:15,682
No.
Wait. How long ago did we leave Earth?

120
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,894
Approximately 30 years ago.

121
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,317
I woke up too soon.

122
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,020
Hello.

123
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:29,584
How do I send a
message to Earth?

124
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:34,005
Interstellar messages are sent by laser array.
This is an expensive service.

125
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,333
- Bite me.
- Happy to help!

126
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:39,752
Planet and connection?

127
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:41,775
Earth.
The HomeStead Company.

128
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,796
There are 30,826 contacts
listed under “HomeStead Company.”

129
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:49,804
I'm emigrating to Homestead II
and I have an emergency.

130
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:52,674
- I have a Customer Help Line.
- Sounds about right.

131
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:54,401
Begin message.

132
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:57,799
Hi.
I'm Jim Preston.

133
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:00,442
I'm a passenger on the Avalon.

134
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,232
I uh...

135
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,817
I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

136
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,503
I woke up too soon.

137
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,197
And I mean...
way too soon.

138
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:16,058
Nobody else is awake.
And...

139
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,295
I don't know how
to get back to sleep.

140
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,711
And the thing is,
there's 90 years to go.

141
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:27,313
At this rate, I'm...

142
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:33,401
I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.
I...

143
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:36,253
Maybe I missed something.
I could use a hand.

144
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,645
That's all.

145
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,041
Thank you.

146
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:43,620
Message sent.

147
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:46,447
Outstanding.

148
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:49,965
- Message will arrive in 19 years.
- Wait, what?

149
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,641
- Earliest reply in 55 years.
- 55 years.

150
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:57,200
We apologize for the delay.

151
00:12:57,225 --> 00:13:00,106
That will be $6012 dollars.

152
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,706
- Afternoon.
- Oh man.

153
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,069
It's good to see another face.

154
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,659
I thought I was
the only one awake!

155
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:22,912
Who want's to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

156
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:26,107
Oh, I mean we're in trouble,
we're not suppose to be here.

157
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:28,167
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

158
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:30,835
- Huh?
- Our little secret.

159
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,216
What can I get for you?

160
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,311
- What?
- You look like a whiskey man.

161
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:38,695
Okay.

162
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:44,955
Oh, you're a robot.

163
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:48,633
Android, technically.

164
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:52,181
 Arthur's the name.

165
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,927
- Jim.
- Please to meet you, Jim.

166
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,194
How much do you know
about this ship?

167
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,780
I don't know.
I know some things.

168
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,132
What do I do if
my hibernation pod malfunctions?

169
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:10,757
Oh.
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

170
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,791
- They never malfunction.
- Well, I woke up early.

171
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:15,562
Can't happen.

172
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,588
How long until we get to Homestead II?

173
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,350
About 90 years or so.

174
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,549
And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

175
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,911
Not until the last 4 months.

176
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:29,369
How is it that I'm sitting here with you
with 90 years to go?

177
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,513
It's not possible for you to be here.

178
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:39,252
Well, I am.

179
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,581
Good morning, it's a beautiful day
here on the Avalon.

180
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:50,704
So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.

181
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,129
Please make a selection.

182
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:08,762
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.

183
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:11,554
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.

184
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,865
I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme,
bill my room please.

185
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,745
Food can be purchase in the ship's...

186
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,169
Sorry.
The French Roast...

187
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:19,143
Sorry.
The Pumpkin Spice...

188
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,346
Sorry.
Vanilla Chai...

189
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:21,674
Sorry.
Sorry.

190
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:23,524
Sorr... Sorr... Sorry.

191
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,180
- Large coffee. Please enjoy your coffee.
- Cream. Sugar.

192
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:28,987
Oh, really?

193
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,806
HIBERNATION POD

194
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,846
Crew podroom access requires special authorization.

195

Grand Conc...

199
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:39,875
Going down.

200
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,066
Please make...
Level...

201
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:45,315
Grand Concourse.

202
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,052
I'm screwed, Arthur.
Completely and ridiculously screwed.

203
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:53,470
Come on, now.
Every cloud has a silver lining.

204
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,769
Guess, I am going to die
of old age on this ship!

205
00:17:57,794 --> 00:17:59,657
Oh, we all die.

206
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,385
Even androids end up
on the scrap heap.

207
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:06,105
I'm your only customer,
why are you always polishing a glass?

208
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:07,817
Trick of the trade.

209
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,622
Makes people nervous when
a bartender just stands there.

210
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:14,613
So, lay some bartender wisdom on me.
I'm lost in space here.

211
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,940
You're not where you want to be.

212
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,394
You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

213
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:27,371
- You said it.
- Well.

214
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:31,323
Say you could snap your fingers and
be wherever you wanted to be.

215
00:18:31,348 --> 00:18:35,037
I'll bet you'd still feel this way.
Not in the right place.

216
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:38,843
Point is, you can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

217
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,610
that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

218
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,233
What are you telling me?

219
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:47,189
Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

220
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:50,041
Live a little.

221
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:51,968
Live a little.

222
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:04,950
- Welcome to the Vienna suite.
- Oh.

223
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:06,575
Oh yeah.

224
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,596
Huh.
Ha ha ha.

225
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:13,005
What?

226
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,332
Oh.

227
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,723
Go, Jim!
Go, Jim!

228
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:22,469
Yeah!

229
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,085
Make that a double jumbo shrimp.
Triple.

230
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,353
Thank you very much.

231
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:29,060
Dance off.

232
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,208
PLAYER 1
JIM

233
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:32,706
Alright.

234
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:36,476
I did exactly what you just did.

235
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:43,134
Large coffee.

236
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:49,215
A margarita, please.

237
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,160
You have had many, Señor.

238
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:54,604
Oh Hector, please.
Another one.

239
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:56,221
Yes, Señor.

240
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:58,018
Thank you.

241
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:03,010
Go, Jim!
Go, Jim!

242
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,779
Get out of here!

243
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:14,745
Come back.
Hey.

244
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:18,389
Come here.

245
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:51,026
Damn!

246
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,512
Welcome, Jim.

247
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:21,279
Please turn your attention to the
screens displaying safety tips.

248
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:25,504
These space suits are designed to withstand
the harsh environment of space.

249
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:31,950
The carbon fiber and polyamide construction
means your suit is inflexible and endurable.

250
00:21:43,826 --> 00:21:47,699
Remember, your space suit
is your life line.

251
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:59,759
Slide the handle on the right
to release the air pressure.

252
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:03,309
Your magnetic boots are now engaged.

253
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:06,759
They can be deactivated using the
control panel on your arm.

254
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:10,072
Press the red button
to open the air lock door.

255
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,357
Have a wonderful time.

256
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,600
Tether attached.

259
00:23:57,164 --> 00:24:02,266
We hope you decide to join us again soon
for another thrilling experience.

<font color="#80ffff">AURORA LANE</font>

263
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:50,440
Aurora.

264
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:54,030
Searching passenger profiles.

265
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,818
I'm Aurora Lane.

266
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:59,142
Passenger 1456.
I'm a writer.

267
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:02,223
I think we tell each other stories
to know we're not alone.

268
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:03,558
 To make contact.

269
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:06,977
Your father was Oliver Lane,
the Pulitzer Prize-winning author.

270
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:08,316
No pressure, right?

271
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:10,252
My Dad used to say:

272
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:14,096
"If you live an ordinary life,
all you have are ordinary stories.

273
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:16,638
You have to live
a life of adventure."

274
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:19,282
So.

275
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,367
Here I am.

276
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:29,096
Good morning.

277
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:35,352
We're starting over...
in every way.

278
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:37,971
I'll have to figure out where to live,
how to live,

279
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,296
who my friends will be.

280
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:40,893
It's like the first day at school.

281
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:44,083
And this school bus took
120 years to get there.

282
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:48,340
We're creating a culture.

283
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:49,712
You're funny.

284
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:52,969
Do you ever read something and
feel like it's written just for you?

285
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:55,006
I don't do a lot of reading.

286
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,992
She's good.

287
00:26:57,461 --> 00:26:58,996
Who's that?

288
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:00,625
Aurora.

289
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,747
Ah.
The sleeping girl.

290
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,142
You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil

291
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,211
but it sure has a nasty
sense of humor.

292
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:13,277
How is that?

293
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:18,157
You get to fly to another planet,
but you'll die along the way.

294
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:22,004
And you find the perfect woman

295
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:24,973
right in front of you.

296
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:28,500
Yet, she's completely out of reach.

297
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:33,571
Yeah, I'll miss New York city.

298
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:35,748
Give me a cup of coffee and
a view of the Chrysler Building,

299
00:27:35,773 --> 00:27:37,430
and I can write all day.

300
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,641
You do have coffee on Homestead II, right?

301
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,876
They better have coffee, if they don't
they have to turn around and come back to Earth.

302
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,069
Is there anything 
you regret leaving behind?

303
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:51,833
Yeah, I'll miss the trees in 
Central Park turning in the Fall.

304
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:55,797
I'll miss the crowd,
all the voices.

305
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:06,125
Say you were trapped
on a desert island,

306
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,783
you had the power to wish
somebody there with you.

307
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:10,776
You wouldn't be alone anymore.

308
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:13,918
But you'd be stranding
a person on the island.

309
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,340
How do you...
Would you make the wish?

310
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:18,890
I don't know.
I've never been on an island.

311
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:20,885
Okay, well...
Yeah.

312
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,479
Forget the island.

313
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,683
Let's say you figured out
how to do something

314
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,503
that would make your life
a million times better.

315
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:33,140
But you knew it was wrong,
and there's no taking it back.

316
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,565
How do you do the math?

317
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,573
Jim.
These are not robot questions.

318
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,650
- I know how to wake Aurora up.
- Oh.

319
00:28:45,675 --> 00:28:48,819
Well, that seems like a fine idea.
You could use some company.

320
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:51,393
I'd be stranding her on this ship
for the rest of her life!

321
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:54,278
Oh.
Well, you can't do that.

322
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:56,625
What am I going to do?

323
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,973
I'm here for you.

324
00:28:57,998 --> 00:29:00,433
Arthur, you're a machine.

325
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:04,101
See.

326
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:07,820
See, you can't feel that,
you don't have feelings.

327
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,391
You see?

328
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:13,089
That doesn't hurt.

329
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,097
And you don't even mind.

330
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:18,391
She...
a person.

331
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:26,403
Don't even think about it.

332
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:28,110
No more Aurora talk.

333
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,787
I'm over it.

334
00:29:29,873 --> 00:29:31,540
I'm moving on.

335
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,721
What am I going to do?
I'm going to sit and thinking about it?

336
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:38,594
I'm not going to... I can't think about it.
So I'm not going to, that's the deal.

337
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:41,245
I've made my decision.
I know what I'm doing.

338
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,093
I just cut it off.

339
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,896
I'm not...
No more.

340
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:47,556
You won't hear me bring
up her name again.

341
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:49,785
I'll never even mention
her name again.

342
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,235
Done.

343
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:55,233
I can't do it.

344
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:02,202
I'm shaving off my beard.

345
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,595
Please don't do it.

346
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:08,396
Good morning, Aurora.

347
00:32:08,397 --> 00:32:10,246
How're you feeling?

348
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:13,399
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

349
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:17,108
You've just spent a 120 years
in suspended animation.

350
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:07,172
Grand Concourse.

351
00:33:07,197 --> 00:33:08,744
Hello?

352
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,864
Anybody?

353
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,251
Hello.

354
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:28,986
Hi.

355
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,628
Are you passenger or crew?

356
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,197
Passenger.

357
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:38,540
Jim Preston.

358
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:40,452
Aurora Lane.

359
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,485
Do you know what's going on?

360
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,016
Nobody else from
my row woke up.

361
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:47,771
Same for me.

362
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:51,418
The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do. But...

363
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,359
I haven't seen them.

364
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:58,389
The crew is still asleep.

365
00:33:59,826 --> 00:34:02,453
Are you saying nobody's awake?

366
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:03,785
Just me.

367
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,149
Just you?

368
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:06,938
It's just us.

369
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:10,348
But somebody's got to land
the ship in a few weeks.

370
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:14,029
We will arrive in approximately 89 years.

371
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,445
89 years?

372
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:21,618
The other passengers
aren't late waking up.

373
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:24,736
We were early.

374
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:31,314
We...
We need help.

375
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:33,148
Where's the crew?

376
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,939
The crew's in a secured
hibernation room.

377
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:39,511
Everything important, the controls,
the reactors, the engines,

378
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,967
it's all behind firewalls,
there's no way through.

379
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:55,635
How long have you been awake?

380
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:58,469
1 year and 3 weeks.

381
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:02,016
No.
No, no, no.

382
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:04,308
No, this can't be happening.

383
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,569
We have to go back to sleep.

384
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:08,652
Aurora, we can't.

385
00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:12,653
We just have to
get back to our pods

386
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,569
and start them up again.

387
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,283
I can't find my pod.
I can't find my pod.

388
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,618
I can't find my pod.
Where are we?

389
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:22,371
It doesn't matter.

390
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:24,783
- Aurora.
- I can't find it.

391
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:26,564
- Stop.
- I can't find which one is mine.

392
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:28,168
- Stop.
- How do I know which one is mine?

393
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:29,338
- I'll help you.
- I can't...

394
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:32,373
Stop.
It doesn't matter.

395
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:38,518
Putting somebody into hibernation
requires special equipment.

396
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:43,089
Remember the facility where they put us
under all the procedures we went through.

397
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:45,454
These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

398
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,009
they'll wake us up
at the right time

399
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:48,852
but they can't put us 
back to sleep.

400
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:52,119
You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation.

401
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:54,466
No.

402
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:56,513
But there has to be.

403
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,005
There has to be.

404
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:10,810
9 o'clock.
Bedtime.

405
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:18,248
I know I should be
working the problem but...

406
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:20,982
I can't even keep my eyes open.

407
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:23,481
You just came out of hibernation.

408
00:36:23,506 --> 00:36:25,818
It's going to be a couple
of days before you're 100%.

409
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:27,910
You should get some rest.

410
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:30,598
I think I'm going to have to.

411
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:34,316
- I'll walk you to your cabin.
- No, it's okay.

412
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:36,115
I'll be alright.

413
00:36:36,983 --> 00:36:38,638
Okay.

414
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,317
Good night, Aurora.

415
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:48,372
More than a year.
I can't imagine.

416
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:51,128
It must have been
so hard for you.

417
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:52,911
It was.

418
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:54,713
Good night, Jim.

419
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:59,755
Please buckle up and
secure any loose items.

420
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:05,387
- Whiskey. Neat.
- Sure thing.

421
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:12,913
How's your day been?

422
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,374
Aurora's awake.

423
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,524
Congratulations.

424
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,066
You don't look happy.

425
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,837
Arthur, can you keep a secret?

426
00:37:26,862 --> 00:37:31,366
Jim, I'm not just a bartender,
I'm a gentleman.

427
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:34,124
Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.

428
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:38,913
She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

429
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:40,640
Of course.

430
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:56,039
How can there be no way to put
someone back into hibernation?

431
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:57,523
What if a pod breaks down?

432
00:37:57,548 --> 00:38:01,998
No hibernation pod has malfunctioned
in thousands of interstellar flights.

433
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,019
Well, I'm awake.

434
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:07,851
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

435
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:10,210
Good morning.
Have you eaten?

436
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:12,313
No, I'm starving.

437
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:14,674
And this is the dumbest machine.

438
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,561
Happy to help!

439
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:24,658
<font color="#ff8080">AVA_SYSTEMS

441
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:31,310
Gold-class breakfast.

442
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:43,739
Well, you're a man of simple tastes.

443
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:46,242
I'm not a gold-class passenger.

444
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,410
French Breakfast Puff
is above my pay grade.

445
00:38:50,435 --> 00:38:52,134
What?
This whole time?

446
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,918
- Yeah.
- What can I get you?

447
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:55,858
- No. No, I'm fine,
- Stop it.

448
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:58,074
really...
Okay.

449
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:01,137
Here you go.

450
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,282
Yeah.

451
00:39:07,307 --> 00:39:09,013
So, I was thinking.

452
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:11,824
Maybe there's another way to go to sleep.
What about the infirmary?

453
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,253
I've checked it out.
It's just scanners and an autodoc.

454
00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:16,717
There could be another
hibernation machine in the cargo hold.

455
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:18,100
I've had that thought too.

456
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,351
And then I read the manifests.

457
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:21,843
It's mostly farming stuff,
machines and trade goods,

458
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:24,186
replacement parts for
computers in Engineering.

459
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:26,518
We're not going to find
a hibernation facility in a box.

460
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:28,234
- We can build our own.
- We can't.

461
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:32,039
- Jim, you're not even trying!
- I have tried everything.

462
00:39:32,064 --> 00:39:34,076
For over a year.

463
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:37,108
I tried everything.

464
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,676
Oh well, I'm not ready to give up.

465
00:39:50,378 --> 00:39:52,332
Infirmary.

466
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,630
What about research articles,
any kind of technical documents?

467
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:05,372
Hibernation technology is proprietary.

468
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:09,860
The following articles deal with
the subject on a theoretical level.

469
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:55,660
New file.
My Voyage.

470
00:40:55,832 --> 00:40:59,839
I boarded the Avalon with an idea,
a destination.

471
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,491
Both now, out of reach.

472
00:41:06,188 --> 00:41:08,588
I've been awake for 7 days,

473
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,181
awake far too soon...

474
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:14,058
and I may well spend
the rest of my life here...

475
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:18,335
...in a steel world a 1,000 meters long.

476
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:21,549
There's another passenger awake.

477
00:41:21,574 --> 00:41:24,436
A mechanic named Jim Preston.

478
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:28,894
He seems to have accepted our fate.

479
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:31,504
But I'm scared.

480
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:34,803
I'm fighting to stay calm.

481
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:42,023
All the other passengers will sleep
for another 90 years.

482
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:48,201
While I live out my life on this ship...
traveling forever...

483
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:50,745
never arriving.

484
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:54,250
My only companion, a total stranger.

485
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,796
Why did you do it?

486
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:08,563
Do what?

487
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:12,068
Emigrate.
Leave Earth.

488
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:14,896
I'm interviewing you.

489
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:15,831
You're what?

490
00:42:15,856 --> 00:42:19,313
You're the first hibernation failure
in the history of space travel.

491
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:21,284
That makes you a story.

492
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,010
- Who are you going to tell?
- Posterity.

493
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:27,413
So why did you give up
your life on Earth?

494
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:31,886
A 120 years space hibernation means you
never see your family or friends again.

495
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:35,595
You'll wake up in a new century,
on a new planet.

496
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:38,039
It's the ultimate geographical suicide.

497
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:40,280
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

498
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:42,257
But it's my interview.

499
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:44,615
Were you running away from something?

500
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,060
No.

501
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,538
- Everything was okay.
- So?

502
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,468
I guess I just wanted a new world.
I don't know, a fresh start.

503
00:42:51,493 --> 00:42:53,577
That's HomeStead Company advertising.

504
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:55,067
- Is it?
- Jim.

505
00:42:55,092 --> 00:42:57,869
I... I know.
I guess, you're right.

506
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:05,792
Back on Earth, when something breaks,
you don't fix it, you replace it.

507
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:09,069
In the colonies, they have problems to solve.

508
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:11,248
They're my kind of problems.

509
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:14,640
And the mechanic is somebody.

510
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:17,155
It's a new world still being built.

511
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:21,393
I can build a house and live in it.

512
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,104
Open country,
room to grow.

513
00:43:29,129 --> 00:43:30,730
Now you're back to slogans.

514
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,905
Can't slogans be true?

515
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:37,663
Do you know how much Homestead
Company's made off its first planet?

516
00:43:37,688 --> 00:43:39,879
8 quadrillion dollars.

517
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:42,590
That's 8 million billions.

518
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:45,351
Colony planets are the
biggest business now.

519
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:47,301
Did you pay full price
for your ticket?

520
00:43:47,326 --> 00:43:49,741
No, I'm in a desirable trade.

521
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:53,478
So they fill your head with dreams,

522
00:43:53,503 --> 00:43:56,301
discount your ticket, and you
fly off to populate their planet

523
00:43:56,325 --> 00:43:59,333
and give HomeStead 20% of everything
that you made for the rest of your life.

524
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:02,644
Not to mention the debt you
run up on this fancy starship.

525
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:05,777
So all you see here
is 5,000 suckers?

526
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:09,670
I see zeroes on the
HomeStead Company's bottom line.

527
00:44:09,695 --> 00:44:13,229
I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

528
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:16,323
5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

529
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:19,554
I'm a journalist. 
I know people.

530
00:44:20,899 --> 00:44:22,633
Really?

531
00:44:22,658 --> 00:44:24,075
This one.

532
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,251
Is he a banker, a teacher or a gardener?

533
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:30,809
- Banker.
- He's a gardener.

534
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:37,599
And her, is she a
Maddison, Donna or Lola?

535
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:40,662
Donna's too serious for that hair.

536
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:42,299
Lola.

537
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,797
- Maddison.
- Shit.

538
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:47,665
Alright.

539
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,756
Chef, accountant or midwife?

540
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:52,476
She has to be a midwife.
There's no way you just made that one up.

541
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,305
She's a midwife.

542
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,535
Good to know
they still have midwives.

543
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:02,546
I like her.
We would be friends.

544
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:04,510
You think you can see that?

545
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,253
Don't you?

546
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:09,488
I do.

547
00:45:09,513 --> 00:45:11,289
A round trip ticket.

548
00:45:11,314 --> 00:45:13,803
That's right.
I was going to fly to Homestead II,

549
00:45:13,828 --> 00:45:16,003
live for a year and then
right back to Earth.

550
00:45:16,028 --> 00:45:17,807
I don't get it.
I left Earth for a new life.

551
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:19,403
But you end up back
where you started.

552
00:45:19,404 --> 00:45:23,451
I end up in the future.
250 years in the future.

553
00:45:23,476 --> 00:45:27,954
On Earth, which is still the
center of civilization, like it or not.

554
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:32,119
And I would be the only writer that ever
travel to the colony world and come back.

555
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:34,007
I'll have a story
no one else can tell.

556
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:35,602
What story?

557
00:45:35,627 --> 00:45:38,067
Humanity's flight to the stars.

558
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:41,813
The greatest migration in human history.
It's the biggest story there is.

559
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:43,549
But you won't know any of the
people who were reading it.

560
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,444
But they'd be reading it.

561
00:45:47,804 --> 00:45:49,804
Well, they would have been.

562
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,772
I'll never write it now.

563
00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:55,223
I don't know if
I'll ever write again.

564
00:45:57,063 --> 00:46:00,789
Jim, I can't think of anything else to try

565
00:46:00,814 --> 00:46:02,907
...to save us.

566
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,997
And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

567
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,591
What is there to do around here?

568
00:46:13,593 --> 00:46:16,499
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

569
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,165
Partner mode.

570
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,626
Come on, get in partner mode.

571
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:31,836
You just stand here,
and then we repeat what they do.

572
00:46:39,428 --> 00:46:41,604
Is there anything else we can do?

573
00:46:41,629 --> 00:46:42,831
- Just do the...
- Okay.

574
00:46:42,856 --> 00:46:44,289
- You don't have to.
- Okay.

575
00:46:44,314 --> 00:46:45,408
Beat down.

576
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:46,931
Hey.

577
00:46:46,956 --> 00:46:48,863
Here we go.
Let's see if... Oh.

578
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:50,821
Whoa!
Whoa!

579
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:53,533
Oh.
Why are you smiling?

580
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:55,769
I'm up 2 points.

581
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,455
Who's the lovely lady?

582
00:46:57,487 --> 00:46:58,848
This is Aurora.

583
00:46:58,873 --> 00:47:01,737
Aurora.
A pleasure.

584
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:06,660
- You did great!
- Okay. One more time.

585
00:47:06,685 --> 00:47:08,075
One more time.
Let's see it.

586
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,115
<font color="#80ffff">Fantasy Drama</font>

587
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,465
Oh!

588
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:21,532
- YES!
- Woo!

589
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:26,064
Sorry I didn't wear pants for a month.

590
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:28,489
That's 7 weeks and 2 days,
to be exact.

591
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:30,010
The man has no shame.

592
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:33,416
Well, you're a little lacking
in that area yourself, Arthur.

593
00:47:35,857 --> 00:47:40,152
I laughed at a man with no pants
until I realised I have no legs.

594
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,101
For a minute, I almost forgot
my life isn't ruined.

595
00:47:49,126 --> 00:47:50,670
I'm sorry.

596
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:52,852
What for?

597
00:47:53,712 --> 00:47:55,431
I'm going to go to bed.

598
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,695
- Good night.
- Alright.

599
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,644
Good night, Aurora.

600
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:05,066
She is wonderful.

601
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:07,492
Excellent choice.

602
00:49:34,813 --> 00:49:36,287
Hello.

603
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:38,065
Hi.

604
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:39,890
Here you go.

605
00:49:45,531 --> 00:49:47,554
Is he asking me on a date?

606
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:51,195
Do you need a pen?

607
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:05,992
She didn't seem that impressed.

608
00:50:23,671 --> 00:50:26,087
"Love to."
She wrote "Love to".

609
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,020
You have a visitor.

610
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,241
Wow.

611
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:57,549
You clean up pretty good yourself.

612
00:50:58,326 --> 00:51:01,536
- You went shopping.
- I went shop... lifting.

613
00:51:06,452 --> 00:51:08,802
Evening.
What can I get for you?

614
00:51:08,827 --> 00:51:11,472
I'll have a Manhattan, please.

615
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:14,715
- Whiskey rocks.
- Coming up.

616
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,360
You two look fine this evening.

617
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:25,870
Thank you, Arthur.

618
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,492
We're on a date!

619
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,584
Very nice.

620
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:31,771
Took you long enough to ask.

621
00:51:31,773 --> 00:51:33,467
I was giving you space.

622
00:51:33,492 --> 00:51:34,821
Oh.

623
00:51:34,934 --> 00:51:38,930
Space, the one thing
I do not need more of.

624
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:43,895
Thank you very much.

625
00:51:44,928 --> 00:51:46,322
That was so good.

626
00:51:46,347 --> 00:51:48,296
Well, it wasn't easy
getting a reservation.

627
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:50,817
They probably going to want
us to give up our table.

628
00:51:50,842 --> 00:51:54,279
- Getting a lot of dirty looks.
- Very popular tonight.

629
00:51:55,831 --> 00:51:57,458
So how's your book coming?

630
00:51:57,484 --> 00:51:59,890
I don't really know what it is yet.

631
00:52:00,532 --> 00:52:03,185
My dad, he started to
write about his life, but...

632
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,237
he had stories.
He...

633
00:52:05,565 --> 00:52:08,187
sailed around Antarctica.
He...

634
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:12,110
was a war reporter.
He... had lovers.

635
00:52:12,157 --> 00:52:14,348
He wrote about his daughter.

636
00:52:14,373 --> 00:52:16,137
- He wrote about you?
- Yeah.

637
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:18,136
I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

638
00:52:18,161 --> 00:52:19,659
How was that?

639
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:21,783
Not always easy.

640
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:24,711
A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

641
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:30,101
I mean, when I was 17,
he had a heart attack.

642
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:33,301
I-I just keep that.

643
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:35,692
End of story.

644
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:41,499
Oh, so serious.
I'm sorry.

645
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,711
We need more wine.

646
00:52:42,736 --> 00:52:44,980
I like to hear about your life.

647
00:52:45,982 --> 00:52:47,483
Thanks.

648
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,100
Why are we here?

649
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,705
You'll see.

650
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:56,209
Best show in town.

651
00:52:59,788 --> 00:53:01,808
So you've done this before?

652
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:03,547
Oh yeah.

653
00:53:03,572 --> 00:53:04,992
And it's safe?

654
00:53:05,017 --> 00:53:06,540
No.

655
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,250
Reasonably safe.

656
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:13,327
Hop in.
You're next.

657
00:53:14,395 --> 00:53:16,310
What about my dress?

658
00:53:18,535 --> 00:53:20,318
Right.

659
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:24,356
Turn around.

660
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,709
Tether attached.

661
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,021
What are you doing?

662
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,164
Do you trust me?

663
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:29,592
Thank you.

664
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:21,146
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

665
00:56:24,209 --> 00:56:26,225
You kill me.

666
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:10,272
You okay?

667
00:57:10,485 --> 00:57:11,899
Yeah.

668
00:57:13,616 --> 00:57:15,301
I am fine.

669
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:16,991
It's just...

670
00:57:24,465 --> 00:57:26,316
Yeah, I know.

671
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:44,678
So, I'm seeing someone.

672
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,576
You'll never guess who.

673
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:51,516
We're the last 2 people in the world
who ever get to get together.

674
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:53,287
But here we are.

675
00:57:53,288 --> 00:57:55,269
The last 2 people in the world.

676
00:57:55,294 --> 00:57:56,392
What did you say?

677
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:58,657
I'm writing, Arthur, hush.

678
00:57:58,998 --> 00:58:02,198
Jim and I live in
an accidental happiness.

679
00:58:02,223 --> 00:58:05,306
Like castaways making their home
on strange shores.

680
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:07,483
"strange shores".
I love it.

681
00:58:07,508 --> 00:58:08,982
You do?
You don't have to say that.

682
00:58:09,006 --> 00:58:11,419
- I know.
- You're not going to eat this?

683
00:58:13,598 --> 00:58:15,595
That seemed fishy to you?

684
00:58:17,218 --> 00:58:18,710
Keep reading.

685
00:58:18,735 --> 00:58:20,261
It's funny.

686
00:58:20,286 --> 00:58:22,504
We all have dreams.

687
00:58:22,886 --> 00:58:26,827
We planned our futures like
we're the captains of our fates.

688
00:58:26,994 --> 00:58:28,692
But we are passengers.

689
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:31,434
We go where fate takes us.

690
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:35,229
Arthur!

691
00:58:35,254 --> 00:58:37,235
This isn't the life we ​​planned.

692
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,043
But it's ours.

693
00:58:39,068 --> 00:58:41,645
And for the first time in my life,

694
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,867
I don't feel alone.

695
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:48,687
We weren't supposed
to find each other,

696
00:58:49,887 --> 00:58:51,570
but we did.

697
00:58:52,203 --> 00:58:55,345
He makes me feel like
my life isn't over.

698
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,680
Like it's just beginning.

699
00:58:58,256 --> 00:58:59,392
How was your day?

700
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:01,725
Good, I wrote a few pages.

701
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,117
Did you find anything
that can help us?

702
00:59:07,437 --> 00:59:09,910
- I did.
- Are they real?

703
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:12,142
I cut them myself.

704
00:59:15,253 --> 00:59:18,795
You know for 2 unlucky people,
we sure got pretty lucky.

705
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:25,075
Attention.

706
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,821
You may wish to proceed
to a Viewing Area.

707
00:59:28,837 --> 00:59:33,067
The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.

708
00:59:34,106 --> 00:59:36,264
Oh my god...

709
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:13,097
That was amazing.

710
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,835
We were a giant.

711
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:23,363
The universe is a present to you.

712
01:00:23,568 --> 01:00:25,040
What?

713
01:00:26,117 --> 01:00:28,233
Happy birthday.

714
01:00:34,776 --> 01:00:43,383
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...

715
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:47,759
Happy birthday, dear Aurora...

716
01:00:47,784 --> 01:00:52,206
Happy birthday to you.

717
01:00:53,957 --> 01:00:55,975
A birthday drink for the birthday girl.

718
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,359
Aren't you going to ask for my I.D.?
I might not be old enough to drink.

719
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,318
Oh, I'd never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

720
01:01:01,343 --> 01:01:02,771
Jim is no gentleman.

721
01:01:02,796 --> 01:01:05,642
Anyway there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

722
01:01:06,553 --> 01:01:07,903
Is that so?

723
01:01:07,928 --> 01:01:11,634
You heard the lady.
I will be right back.

724
01:01:25,801 --> 01:01:28,459
This is a perfect birthday drink,
thank you.

725
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:31,657
I remember this day, a year ago.

726
01:01:31,683 --> 01:01:34,586
Jim was so looking forward
to meeting you.

727
01:01:34,998 --> 01:01:36,401
What?

728
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:38,671
How could he be
looking forward to it?

729
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:42,219
Oh, he spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

730
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:45,255
He couldn't stop talking about you.

731
01:01:49,012 --> 01:01:51,123
Jim woke me up.

732
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,073
Oh, yes.

733
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,506
He said it was the
hardest decision of his life,

734
01:01:56,531 --> 01:01:59,641
but I see it
worked out just fine.

735
01:02:11,573 --> 01:02:13,086
What?

736
01:02:15,446 --> 01:02:17,718
Did you wake me up?

737
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:27,013
Yes.
I woke you up.

738
01:02:30,928 --> 01:02:32,675
How...

739
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:34,871
How could you do it?

740
01:02:37,262 --> 01:02:39,102
I tried not to.

741
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:47,344
I'm going to be sick.

742
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,029
I can't see!

743
01:02:51,261 --> 01:02:53,049
Aurora, please.

744
01:02:53,074 --> 01:02:56,246
Stay away from me!

745
01:02:58,952 --> 01:03:02,171
I got to get off this ship.
I got to get off this ship.

746
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:03,697
I got to get off.

747
01:04:18,877 --> 01:04:20,997
Can I talk to you?

748
01:05:49,005 --> 01:05:50,859
Aurora.

749
01:05:51,092 --> 01:05:54,399
I know nothing I can say
will make this okay.

750
01:05:54,598 --> 01:05:56,581
But please listen.

751
01:05:56,606 --> 01:05:58,634
I was so alone

752
01:05:59,007 --> 01:06:00,995
for so long.

753
01:06:02,096 --> 01:06:04,509
I felt like I was disappearing.

754
01:06:05,139 --> 01:06:08,511
The night I first saw you,
I was ready to...

755
01:06:11,498 --> 01:06:13,591
You saved my life.

756
01:06:15,886 --> 01:06:19,061
And I know that's no excuse
for what I did.

757
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:22,515
I read everything you wrote.

758
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:26,203
And I fell in love
with your voice

759
01:06:26,228 --> 01:06:29,323
and with the way
your mind works.

760
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,611
I fell in love with you.

761
01:06:32,796 --> 01:06:34,717
And all of a sudden,

762
01:06:34,895 --> 01:06:38,804
it was like I wasn't trapped anymore.

763
01:06:38,882 --> 01:06:42,355
My pointless life suddenly had meaning.

764
01:06:44,597 --> 01:06:46,777
And I wish I could take it back.

765
01:06:48,156 --> 01:06:49,930
But I can't.

766
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,802
Aurora, I don't want to lose you.

767
01:06:52,827 --> 01:06:55,196
I DON'T CARE !!!

768
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:57,424
I don't care what you want!

769
01:06:57,449 --> 01:07:00,185
I don't care
why you woke me up!

770
01:07:00,595 --> 01:07:03,702
You took my life!

771
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:27,815
Please standby.

772
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,545
Your suite's control center is rebooting.

773
01:07:50,481 --> 01:07:52,390
<font color="#ff8080">DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM
FAILURE</font>

774
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:55,319
<font color="#ff8080">DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM FAILURE</font>
CRITICAL ERROR

775
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:08,403
I envy you, Arthur.

776
01:08:08,994 --> 01:08:10,218
How so?

777
01:08:10,243 --> 01:08:12,262
You have a purpose.

778
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,522
You're always happy.

779
01:08:16,865 --> 01:08:19,256
How's your book coming along?

780
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:21,772
I've never written about me before.

781
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,721
I think it's some of the
best work I've ever done,

782
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:26,230
and I don't even know
why I'm doing it.

783
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:30,001
There's only one person who could read it
and I can't stand him.

784
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:34,143
They say time heals all wounds.

785
01:08:36,717 --> 01:08:39,278
Broken hearts aren't that simple, Arthur.

786
01:08:41,908 --> 01:08:44,217
You wouldn't understand.

787
01:08:45,031 --> 01:08:46,830
Arthur!

788
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:53,028
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

789
01:08:53,053 --> 01:08:54,957
It's Wednesday.

790
01:09:02,563 --> 01:09:04,356
The bar is all yours.

791
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:15,060
What will you have?
Whiskey?

792
01:09:15,837 --> 01:09:17,323
Coffee.

793
01:09:17,348 --> 01:09:19,391
- Aurora, we love you!
- Aurora, we love you!

794
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:22,009
What are we going to do without you?
We'll miss you.

795
01:09:24,151 --> 01:09:25,592
This is the bravest woman I know.

796
01:09:25,617 --> 01:09:27,170
- Hi, Aurora!
- Hi, Aurora!

797
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:30,924
I promise that
I will think of you every day.

798
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:33,059
When you wake up
I'll be gone,

799
01:09:33,084 --> 01:09:36,283
but just know that
I will never forget you.

800
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:38,611
You're my best friend.

801
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,061
You'e never happy here,
I know.

802
01:09:42,369 --> 01:09:44,749
Nothing was ever enough for you.

803
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:48,646
You know, you don't have to go.
You could-

804
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:51,695
You could do whatever it is
you have to do right here.

805
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:54,827
But...

806
01:09:54,852 --> 01:09:58,627
Since you're going,
here's my wish.

807
01:10:00,295 --> 01:10:04,590
I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart. And...

808
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,468
I hope you let him in.

809
01:10:08,659 --> 01:10:13,501
I hope you realized you don't have
to do something amazing to be happy.

810
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:16,401
Go.

811
01:10:16,426 --> 01:10:18,075
Have fun.

812
01:10:18,537 --> 01:10:20,544
Take chances.

813
01:10:21,995 --> 01:10:24,305
Um, okay.

814
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:27,257
I love you, Aurora.

815
01:10:27,526 --> 01:10:28,910
Bye.

816
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:33,524
Morning, Arthur!

817
01:10:33,678 --> 01:10:34,709
Coffee please.

818
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:36,146
Coming up.

819
01:10:41,518 --> 01:10:43,763
Are you soiling my bar stool?

820
01:10:43,788 --> 01:10:46,943
You want to make things,
you got to get your hands dirty.

821
01:10:47,046 --> 01:10:50,275
- And what have you been making?
- Improvements.

822
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:53,112
Grand Concourse.

823
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:22,033
First floor.

824
01:11:34,651 --> 01:11:36,728
Gold-class breakfast.

825
01:11:36,753 --> 01:11:38,117
Huh!

826
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:55,278
This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.

827
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:59,418
Who the hell planted
a tree on my ship?

828
01:12:20,765 --> 01:12:23,329
- Who did that?
- I did.

829
01:12:23,354 --> 01:12:24,592
Who are you?

830
01:12:24,617 --> 01:12:26,318
Jim Preston.

831
01:12:27,459 --> 01:12:29,015
Aurora Lane.

832
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,478
Anybody else awake?

833
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:32,204
Just me and him.

834
01:12:32,525 --> 01:12:34,855
How far along are we?

835
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,035
88 years to go.

836
01:12:45,265 --> 01:12:47,437
Hibernation failure.

837
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,126
They said that couldn't happen.

838
01:12:50,151 --> 01:12:54,190
But 3 people,
3 pod failures.

839
01:12:58,664 --> 01:13:01,387
You have no idea how long
I've been trying to get in there.

840
01:13:01,412 --> 01:13:04,057
Now that you're in.
Don't touch anything.

841
01:13:04,082 --> 01:13:05,580
This is where you work?

842
01:13:05,605 --> 01:13:08,240
No, this is flight crew,
I'm a Deck Chief.

843
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:11,840
OPS,
Navigation comp.

844
01:13:14,003 --> 01:13:16,545
Unauthorized personnel.

845
01:13:17,411 --> 01:13:18,904
Sorry.

846
01:13:20,565 --> 01:13:23,827
If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

847
01:13:23,852 --> 01:13:26,603
So whatever's wrong with the ship,
NavComp's still on the job.

848
01:13:26,628 --> 01:13:28,164
There's something wrong with the ship?

849
01:13:28,189 --> 01:13:29,855
3 pod failures?
Yeah.

850
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,704
There's something wrong.
Question is what.

851
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:36,815
That's strange.

852
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,401
I should be getting diagnostics
from all over the ship right here,

853
01:13:39,426 --> 01:13:41,712
but there's no data.

854
01:13:43,165 --> 01:13:45,035
Got to check
all the systems manually.

855
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,892
Can't we turn the ship around?
Go back to Earth?

856
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:48,608
No, we're doing 50% of lightspeed.

857
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,880
Turning back would take just
as much time as going on.

858
01:13:50,905 --> 01:13:52,712
Well, there's got to be
something we can do!

859
01:13:52,737 --> 01:13:55,473
Sorry, we're going where we're going.

860
01:13:58,011 --> 01:13:59,486
You okay?

861
01:14:00,056 --> 01:14:01,780
Hibernation hangover.

862
01:14:01,805 --> 01:14:03,599
Get it all the time.

863
01:14:03,748 --> 01:14:05,657
Grand Concourse.

864
01:14:05,682 --> 01:14:09,409
2 years, huh?
Any more trees I need to know about?

865
01:14:09,434 --> 01:14:10,834
LOOK OUT!

866
01:14:15,175 --> 01:14:16,889
I've never seen this happen before.

867
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:18,821
Those robots have been breaking down.

868
01:14:18,846 --> 01:14:22,010
This guy makes 15?

869
01:14:22,117 --> 01:14:23,074
15.

870
01:14:23,108 --> 01:14:24,785
The breakfast bar went crazy today.

871
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:25,882
And the elevator.

872
01:14:25,907 --> 01:14:28,871
Last week my door broke.
I was trapped in my cabin for 2 days.

873
01:14:28,896 --> 01:14:30,510
You were?

874
01:14:30,662 --> 01:14:33,943
Things like that don't happen.
Not on this ship.

875
01:14:33,968 --> 01:14:37,243
There are 60 of these
tech-stations on every deck.

876
01:14:37,268 --> 01:14:39,001
Docking slats.

877
01:14:39,026 --> 01:14:40,750
Data sinks automatically,
you got it?

878
01:14:40,775 --> 01:14:42,478
- Mm.
- Yeah.
- Okay.

879
01:14:42,503 --> 01:14:44,803
You take decks 1 and 2.
You take decks 3 and 4.

880
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:49,010
I'm going down to the Hibernation Bay,
to check our pods.

881
01:14:49,423 --> 01:14:51,538
Now that should be interesting.

882
01:15:01,692 --> 01:15:04,213
Aren't you supposed to be
making your rounds.

883
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,461
I finished.

884
01:15:08,575 --> 01:15:10,644
I checked your pod.

885
01:15:11,356 --> 01:15:13,973
The problem's very simple.
The clock chips burned out.

886
01:15:13,998 --> 01:15:16,817
It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

887
01:15:16,842 --> 01:15:18,502
My pod's more complicated.

888
01:15:18,527 --> 01:15:21,368
A bunch of system failures,
it all happened at the same time,

889
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:23,953
the whole damn thing went haywire.

890
01:15:25,595 --> 01:15:27,886
Which explains why I'm feeling so bad.

891
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:30,208
But Aurora's pod...

892
01:15:33,398 --> 01:15:35,500
You did this.

893
01:15:37,528 --> 01:15:38,570
Yeah.

894
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,904
All this time, I'm thinking you're
one lucky son of a bitch

895
01:15:40,929 --> 01:15:43,126
to get stuck with Aurora.

896
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:48,501
It wasn't luck, was it?

897
01:15:48,526 --> 01:15:49,686
No.

898
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,386
She knows?

899
01:15:51,411 --> 01:15:53,373
She knows.

900
01:15:54,645 --> 01:15:56,392
How long were you alone?

901
01:15:56,417 --> 01:15:58,148
A year.

902
01:16:01,447 --> 01:16:03,255
Still...

903
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:06,424
Damn.

904
01:16:24,609 --> 01:16:26,452
Same as Jim's.

905
01:16:27,032 --> 01:16:29,101
System shut downs.

906
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,853
Everywhere, but no apparent connection.

907
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,996
You saw the hibernation pods?

908
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,794
I saw.

909
01:16:39,086 --> 01:16:41,093
So you know.

910
01:16:41,983 --> 01:16:43,953
What Jim did.

911
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:47,703
Yeah.

912
01:16:48,206 --> 01:16:49,543
And?

913
01:16:49,568 --> 01:16:52,515
- It's not my duty...
- He woke me up!

914
01:16:52,539 --> 01:16:55,244
- He took away my life!
- I know and I'm sorry.

915
01:16:55,269 --> 01:16:58,281
- But there's work I like...
- It's murder!

916
01:17:00,869 --> 01:17:02,454
You're right, Aurora.

917
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:06,199
But the drowning man will always
try to drag somebody down with him.

918
01:17:06,237 --> 01:17:09,875
It ain't right,
but the man is drowning.

919
01:17:10,871 --> 01:17:12,998
This one makes 16.

920
01:17:15,929 --> 01:17:17,648
Yeah.

921
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:22,074
Hey.
Are you okay?

922
01:17:23,835 --> 01:17:26,521
- You should go rest.
- Yeah.

923
01:17:27,191 --> 01:17:31,992
But just for a couple of hours and then,
back at it first thing in the morning.

924
01:18:24,854 --> 01:18:27,770
<font color="#ff8080">GRAVITY LOSS</font>

925
01:19:35,712 --> 01:19:37,234
<font color="#ff8080">GRAVITY DRIVE</font>

926
01:19:37,259 --> 01:19:38,413
<font color="#80ffff">GRAVITY DRIVE</font>

927
01:20:18,678 --> 01:20:20,516
I was in the pool
when the gravity gave out.

928
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:21,578
Are you okay?

929
01:20:21,603 --> 01:20:23,291
We need to find Gus.

930
01:20:24,685 --> 01:20:27,012
Gus!
Gus!

931
01:20:27,273 --> 01:20:30,563
Gravity loss means that whatever is wrong
is starting to hit the big ticket items.

932
01:20:30,588 --> 01:20:32,258
Not good.

933
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:37,345
Every failure is a burnout process,
everything on board is thinking too hard.

934
01:20:37,797 --> 01:20:39,408
Why?

935
01:20:39,974 --> 01:20:42,444
Computer, display these failures over time.

936
01:20:42,469 --> 01:20:45,076
Processing timeline.

937
01:20:46,068 --> 01:20:48,201
Cascade failure.

938
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:51,322
It started 2 years ago,
power surge.

939
01:20:51,994 --> 01:20:54,650
17 failures in 1 day.

940
01:20:54,881 --> 01:20:57,202
Including hibernation pod 1498.

941
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:58,857
That's me.

942
01:20:58,882 --> 01:21:00,559
Woke me up.

943
01:21:02,078 --> 01:21:04,606
- What happened that day?
- Something big.

944
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:07,114
A major system went down somewhere.

945
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,486
Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load

946
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:11,289
but the load's too heavy.

947
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:13,594
Whatever started this
we got to find it.

948
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,782
- And fix it.
- How bad can this get?

949
01:21:17,264 --> 01:21:19,548
Give me a risk analysis
based on this data.

950
01:21:19,573 --> 01:21:21,228
Extrapolating.

951
01:21:21,253 --> 01:21:23,726
Emission critical failure is imminent.

952
01:21:23,751 --> 01:21:27,075
Failing systems:
Life support. Fusion reactor.

953
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,951
So we're stranded...

954
01:21:28,976 --> 01:21:30,182
Ion drive.

955
01:21:30,207 --> 01:21:32,408
... on a sinking ship.

956
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:42,490
Main Engineering.

957
01:21:42,515 --> 01:21:45,906
Not a lot of things big enough
to hit this ship that hard.

958
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:51,799
With diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

959
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,677
Where do we start?

960
01:21:54,304 --> 01:21:55,723
Gus!

961
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:02,898
Scan complete.
Analyzing data.

962
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:06,150
612 DISORDERS FOUND

963
01:22:06,151 --> 01:22:08,174
What does it say
is wrong with me?

964
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:09,675
It's a few things.

965
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,728
612 disorders found.

966
01:22:12,753 --> 01:22:14,674
Get me out of here.

967
01:22:28,683 --> 01:22:30,322
What's the prognosis?

968
01:22:30,347 --> 01:22:34,685
Critical diagnosis cannot be discussed
without a doctor on attendance.

969
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:38,710
Override on my authority,
I.D. 2317.

970
01:22:38,735 --> 01:22:40,000
Lay it on me, doc.

971
01:22:40,025 --> 01:22:41,947
Pan-systemic necrosis.

972
01:22:41,972 --> 01:22:44,994
Progressive organ failure.
Cause unknown.

973
01:22:45,019 --> 01:22:47,554
My goofy hibernation pod,
that's the cause.

974
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:50,649
- What's the treatment?
- Various treatments are possible.

975
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:54,019
None will meaningfully
extend the patient's life.

976
01:22:56,876 --> 01:22:58,157
How long have I got?

977
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,648
Your end of life transition
is already under way.

978
01:23:02,247 --> 01:23:06,832
These sedatives will alleviate
your suffering during these final hours.

979
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:25,438
Gus?

980
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,231
I need a minute.

981
01:24:01,544 --> 01:24:04,396
We are experiencing difficulties in flight.

982
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:06,693
- Gus!
- Gus!

983
01:24:06,718 --> 01:24:07,681
Where can he be?

984
01:24:07,706 --> 01:24:11,101
For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

985
01:24:17,305 --> 01:24:21,047
For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

986
01:24:21,072 --> 01:24:23,803
Should have took the damn pills.

987
01:24:23,804 --> 01:24:26,925
- I'll go get them.
- No, stay here.

988
01:24:27,947 --> 01:24:29,663
Sit.

989
01:24:33,984 --> 01:24:36,718
You two take care of each other.

990
01:24:45,638 --> 01:24:47,941
My I.D..

991
01:24:48,856 --> 01:24:51,862
Get you where you need to go.

992
01:24:52,526 --> 01:24:54,719
Fix the ship.

993
01:24:55,464 --> 01:24:58,088
Find out what's wrong with her.

994
01:25:00,682 --> 01:25:02,711
How do I look?

995
01:25:03,068 --> 01:25:05,536
You look magnificent.

996
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:09,289
Ladies love a dressed man.

997
01:25:17,638 --> 01:25:19,707
What do we do now?

998
01:25:26,185 --> 01:25:27,898
This can't be good.

999
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:32,578
I'm going back to Engineering.

1000
01:25:32,603 --> 01:25:34,547
Can you fix this?

1001
01:25:34,731 --> 01:25:36,415
I need your help.

1002
01:25:39,598 --> 01:25:41,095
Let's go!

1003
01:26:03,344 --> 01:26:04,817
Arthur!

1004
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:21,711
Let's go!

1005
01:26:24,978 --> 01:26:27,085
Main Engineering.

1006
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,048
Can't we wake up
some of the crew?

1007
01:26:29,073 --> 01:26:31,465
It will take them take too long to recover,
we don't have that kind of time.

1008
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,653
What are we even looking for?

1009
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:35,768
Something broken.

1010
01:26:36,036 --> 01:26:37,609
Something big.

1011
01:26:37,763 --> 01:26:39,364
Come on!

1012
01:26:40,783 --> 01:26:43,099
- Is it broken?
- It seems okay.

1013
01:26:43,124 --> 01:26:44,207
What next?

1014
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:46,435
Power Plant.
This way.

1015
01:26:52,202 --> 01:26:54,019
Come on.

1016
01:26:54,196 --> 01:26:55,925
Whole section's closed off.
Something's wrong.

1017
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,741
We're looking for wrong.

1018
01:26:57,766 --> 01:26:59,507
Try to open it.

1019
01:27:10,805 --> 01:27:12,200
Warning.

1020
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:16,067
Pressure door.
Lock down initiated.

1021
01:27:18,588 --> 01:27:20,324
Please secure all doors.

1022
01:27:20,349 --> 01:27:22,378
Hold on!

1023
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:27,307
Warning.
Dangerous oxygen level.

1024
01:27:27,332 --> 01:27:29,680
Please secure all doors.

1025
01:27:38,763 --> 01:27:43,145
Dangerous oxygen level.
Please secure all doors.

1026
01:27:47,212 --> 01:27:49,287
Grab it!

1027
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:58,625
Pressurizing cabin unsuccessful.

1028
01:28:06,884 --> 01:28:08,977
Pressure normalized.

1029
01:28:09,549 --> 01:28:11,677
Oxygen level restored.

1030
01:28:11,702 --> 01:28:13,588
End lock down.

1031
01:28:13,613 --> 01:28:16,317
A hole in the ship.

1032
01:28:18,286 --> 01:28:20,143
More than one.

1033
01:28:23,135 --> 01:28:25,581
How did that even happen?
This ship is supposed to be meteor-proof.

1034
01:28:25,606 --> 01:28:27,738
I guess one got through.

1035
01:28:35,483 --> 01:28:36,940
It's hot!

1036
01:28:43,566 --> 01:28:45,585
I think we found it.

1037
01:28:55,143 --> 01:28:57,603
It's the reactor control computer.

1038
01:29:03,554 --> 01:29:05,193
This is what hit us 2 years ago.

1039
01:29:05,218 --> 01:29:06,778
Jim.

1040
01:29:07,317 --> 01:29:09,513
How can we fix this?

1041
01:29:12,386 --> 01:29:13,414
We're going to die.

1042
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:15,637
There's replacement parts for everything.

1043
01:29:20,004 --> 01:29:21,233
Light.

1044
01:29:21,258 --> 01:29:22,669
Sorry.

1045
01:29:24,464 --> 01:29:27,158
As soon as I pull this module,
the entire computer is going to shut down.

1046
01:29:27,183 --> 01:29:28,992
Well, what happens then?

1047
01:29:30,419 --> 01:29:32,989
I'll get it back up
as quickly as I can.

1048
01:29:36,842 --> 01:29:38,376
Hurry!

1049
01:29:40,537 --> 01:29:41,913
Jim!

1050
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:47,210
Control computer restored.

1051
01:29:48,097 --> 01:29:50,160
Venting reactor.

1052
01:29:51,908 --> 01:29:53,097
But we fixed it!

1053
01:29:53,122 --> 01:29:57,290
Reactor vent failed.
Manual override required.

1054
01:30:02,579 --> 01:30:04,116
Vent failure.

1055
01:30:04,141 --> 01:30:05,881
- Come on!
- Jim.

1056
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:12,001
Outer door non-responsive.

1057
01:30:12,027 --> 01:30:14,072
What does that mean?

1058
01:30:15,814 --> 01:30:17,592
The outer door is jammed.

1059
01:30:17,617 --> 01:30:19,476
We got to open that door
and cool the reactor down

1060
01:30:19,508 --> 01:30:21,419
or the whole ship's going to blow.

1061
01:30:21,444 --> 01:30:22,242
How?

1062
01:30:22,267 --> 01:30:23,867
I got to go out there.

1063
01:30:23,908 --> 01:30:25,973
Open it from the outside.

1064
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,891
I open the door
I get cleared.

1065
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,075
You blow that fire into space.

1066
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,705
- You get cleared?
- You can talk to me through this.

1067
01:30:33,706 --> 01:30:36,242
What happens to you
when that door opens?

1068
01:30:46,343 --> 01:30:48,846
Heat shield.
It might help.

1069
01:30:57,213 --> 01:30:58,829
You might need this.

1070
01:31:12,431 --> 01:31:14,180
It's going to be okay.

1071
01:31:23,714 --> 01:31:25,268
I better go.

1072
01:31:30,161 --> 01:31:31,606
Jim.

1073
01:31:31,965 --> 01:31:33,448
Jim.

1074
01:31:35,831 --> 01:31:37,561
Come back to me.

1075
01:31:39,103 --> 01:31:41,717
I can't live on the ship
without you.

1076
01:32:06,859 --> 01:32:09,475
Warning.
Temperature critical.

1077
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,861
AHHHH!

1078
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:24,318
What's wrong?

1079
01:32:25,113 --> 01:32:26,936
What's the matter?
Are you okay?

1080
01:32:26,963 --> 01:32:28,469
Nothing.
Go.

1081
01:32:28,494 --> 01:32:29,459
You sure?

1082
01:32:29,484 --> 01:32:30,880
Go.

1083
01:32:38,388 --> 01:32:40,196
I'm in the vent tube.

1084
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:44,140
New anchor point.
Reset tether.

1085
01:32:47,408 --> 01:32:49,058
I see the door.

1086
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:52,052
Temperature level rising.

1087
01:32:58,783 --> 01:33:01,713
Warning.
Temperature critical.

1088
01:33:07,549 --> 01:33:10,067
Containment unstable.

1089
01:33:11,203 --> 01:33:12,389
Where are you?

1090
01:33:12,414 --> 01:33:13,492
I'm at the door.

1091
01:33:13,517 --> 01:33:15,141
I'm ready, just say when.

1092
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:16,814
There goes.

1093
01:33:19,757 --> 01:33:22,810
The door won't open.
I'll have to bypass it.

1094
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:27,281
Temperature level rising.

1095
01:33:27,904 --> 01:33:29,237
Jim, come on!

1096
01:33:29,262 --> 01:33:31,004
Please, hurry!

1097
01:33:31,029 --> 01:33:34,412
- Okay, I'm trying it again.
- Tell me when you're cleared.

1098
01:33:38,168 --> 01:33:38,860
No!

1099
01:33:38,885 --> 01:33:40,146
What?

1100
01:33:40,944 --> 01:33:42,665
What's going on?

1101
01:33:42,836 --> 01:33:44,332
Jim?

1102
01:33:48,418 --> 01:33:49,470
Jim!

1103
01:33:49,495 --> 01:33:51,623
The door won't stay open.

1104
01:33:52,615 --> 01:33:56,426
I think I have to stay here,
hold the door open.

1105
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,478
No!

1106
01:33:58,503 --> 01:34:00,112
No way, get out of there!

1107
01:34:00,137 --> 01:34:01,704
I can't.

1108
01:34:01,854 --> 01:34:03,364
Jim...

1109
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,297
We're out of time.

1110
01:34:06,448 --> 01:34:08,150
Containment unstable.

1111
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:09,723
Jim?

1112
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:17,706
Vent the reactor.

1113
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:26,519
No, you don't understand!

1114
01:34:26,836 --> 01:34:29,590
If I open the door right now
it will kill you!

1115
01:34:29,616 --> 01:34:30,777
I'm hoping not.

1116
01:34:30,802 --> 01:34:32,678
Come back in,
we'll think of something else.

1117
01:34:32,703 --> 01:34:34,625
There is nothing else.

1118
01:34:35,799 --> 01:34:37,262
Jim!

1119
01:34:37,846 --> 01:34:39,660
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

1120
01:34:39,685 --> 01:34:42,893
- Aurora
- Warning. Temperature level exceeded.

1121
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:45,472
This is not how I suppose 
is going to happen!

1122
01:34:46,204 --> 01:34:47,654
Aurora, this ship is going to go.

1123
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,289
I don't care!
You die, I die.

1124
01:34:50,565 --> 01:34:53,784
There are 5,000 other people
on this ship, Aurora.

1125
01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:56,881
We have to do this.

1126
01:34:57,451 --> 01:34:59,780
Maximum pressure reached.

1127
01:35:02,951 --> 01:35:05,406
Do it.
Now.

1128
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:08,896
Maximum cabin pressure reached.

1129
01:35:29,937 --> 01:35:32,053
Temperature dropping.

1130
01:35:33,433 --> 01:35:34,815
Jim.

1131
01:35:52,851 --> 01:35:55,068
- Jim.
- Vent successful.

1132
01:35:55,093 --> 01:35:57,447
Rebooting process initiated.

1133
01:35:57,472 --> 01:35:59,665
Jim, please say something.

1134
01:36:36,084 --> 01:36:38,585
Suit pressure dropping.

1135
01:36:41,134 --> 01:36:44,303
Return to ship immediately.

1136
01:36:45,325 --> 01:36:46,771
Aurora.

1137
01:36:48,295 --> 01:36:49,532
It worked!

1138
01:36:49,557 --> 01:36:51,693
You did it, you can come in!

1139
01:36:51,867 --> 01:36:53,469
Yeah, about that...

1140
01:36:53,494 --> 01:36:55,256
What's the matter?
Are you hurt?

1141
01:36:55,937 --> 01:36:57,800
I got blown out of the tube.

1142
01:36:57,824 --> 01:36:58,704
What?

1143
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:01,603
My tether broke.
I can't get back to the ship.

1144
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:04,372
I'll come out. I'll come out.
I'll pull you in.

1145
01:37:04,397 --> 01:37:07,259
Warning.
Oxygen level critical.

1146
01:37:07,284 --> 01:37:10,133
Return to ship immediately.

1147
01:37:18,017 --> 01:37:20,882
Aurora, I'm sorry...

1148
01:37:22,574 --> 01:37:23,816
... for everything.

1149
01:37:23,841 --> 01:37:25,674
Shut up, I'm coming.

1150
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:30,808
I wish we'd have met
in 90 years.

1151
01:37:35,576 --> 01:37:39,203
I...
I'd build you a house.

1152
01:37:43,369 --> 01:37:45,587
I'll read your book.

1153
01:37:47,823 --> 01:37:49,706
It's a good feeling.

1154
01:38:01,941 --> 01:38:03,192
Tether attached.

1155
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:05,484
Locate Jim Preston.

1156
01:38:09,555 --> 01:38:12,568
Jim Preston, located.

1157
01:38:13,138 --> 01:38:14,902
I'm coming to get you.

1158
01:38:39,462 --> 01:38:41,063
JIM!

1159
01:39:40,737 --> 01:39:43,140
I'm sorry.
The patient is dead.

1160
01:39:43,165 --> 01:39:44,622
WELL, RESUSCITATE HIM!

1161
01:39:44,647 --> 01:39:48,151
Postmortem operations require
authorized medical supervision.

1162
01:39:48,176 --> 01:39:49,853
No!

1163
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:00,612
Override!
Override on my authority!

1164
01:40:00,637 --> 01:40:04,025
I.D. 17...

1165
01:40:05,468 --> 01:40:06,873
2...

1166
01:40:07,207 --> 01:40:08,964
2...

1167
01:40:09,414 --> 01:40:10,544
2317.

1168
01:40:10,569 --> 01:40:13,495
2317!
I.D. 2317!

1169
01:40:16,642 --> 01:40:18,141
<font color="#80ffff">RESUSCITATION</font>

1170
01:40:18,166 --> 01:40:19,894
<font color="#80ffff">DEFIBRILLATION
OXYGENATION</font>

1171
01:40:21,316 --> 01:40:23,141
Multiple procedures are not recommended.

1172
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:24,685
OVERRIDE!

1173
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:26,349
DO IT, NOW!

1174
01:40:26,374 --> 01:40:28,025
Executing.

1175
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,637
Jim.

1176
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,232
Jim.

1177
01:41:59,939 --> 01:42:02,252
You brought me back.

1178
01:42:02,277 --> 01:42:03,869
Yeah.

1179
01:42:27,773 --> 01:42:28,614
Thank you.

1180
01:42:28,615 --> 01:42:30,028
Be still.

1181
01:42:30,053 --> 01:42:31,663
Of course.

1182
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:18,820
There's something I have to show you.

1183
01:43:18,845 --> 01:43:22,022
In Command mode, it turns out
the autodoc has a option

1184
01:43:22,047 --> 01:43:24,625
called "Stabilize and Suspend".

1185
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:27,496
It stops all metabolic activity.

1186
01:43:29,176 --> 01:43:30,409
What are you saying?

1187
01:43:30,434 --> 01:43:32,953
It's ​​Gus' idea.
It can be like hibernation.

1188
01:43:32,978 --> 01:43:35,981
Inside the autodoc,
you can go back to sleep.

1189
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:42,358
But there's only one autodoc.

1190
01:43:46,356 --> 01:43:47,765
Yeah.

1191
01:43:49,914 --> 01:43:52,349
And you're going to
lay down in it,

1192
01:43:52,459 --> 01:43:54,250
and fall asleep.

1193
01:43:55,034 --> 01:43:57,303
And you'll wake up on Homestead II,

1194
01:43:57,328 --> 01:43:59,352
and you'll write you book.

1195
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:04,229
You finish your journey.
You do what you set out to do.

1196
01:44:12,532 --> 01:44:14,505
You'll be alone.

1197
01:44:15,577 --> 01:44:19,629
I've been alone before
and I'll be fine.

1198
01:44:20,678 --> 01:44:23,038
But I'll never see you again.

1199
01:44:26,163 --> 01:44:28,050
I'll come and visit you.

1200
01:45:10,769 --> 01:45:13,296
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

1201
01:45:14,717 --> 01:45:16,376
Lovely as ever.

1202
01:45:16,401 --> 01:45:18,728
Thank you, Arthur.
You're looking very well yourself.

1203
01:45:18,753 --> 01:45:20,525
Thanks to you.

1204
01:45:21,516 --> 01:45:23,055
What's that?

1205
01:45:25,112 --> 01:45:28,107
Something I wanted to
give you for a long time.

1206
01:45:34,428 --> 01:45:36,458
It's beautiful.

1207
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:51,847
Took you long enough to ask.

1208
01:45:54,386 --> 01:45:57,776
Champagne.
I'll wait.

1209
01:46:14,522 --> 01:46:16,403
Hell of a life.

1210
01:46:18,918 --> 01:46:20,812
Hell of a life.

1211
01:46:39,202 --> 01:46:43,339
HOMESTEAD II

1212
01:46:43,364 --> 01:46:50,193
HOMESTEAD II
88 YEARS LATER

1213
01:46:51,845 --> 01:46:55,231
Crew wake up process initiated.

1214
01:46:55,912 --> 01:46:57,934
My fellow passengers,

1215
01:46:57,959 --> 01:47:03,273
if you are reading this, then the
starship Avalon has reached its destination.

1216
01:47:03,298 --> 01:47:05,406
Grand Concourse.

1217
01:47:05,591 --> 01:47:08,008
A lot happened while you slept.

1218
01:47:15,129 --> 01:47:16,982
A friend once said,

1219
01:47:17,007 --> 01:47:20,263
"You can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

1220
01:47:20,288 --> 01:47:23,839
that you forget to make
the most of where you are.

1221
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,853
We got lost along the way

1222
01:47:27,405 --> 01:47:29,411
but we found each other.

1223
01:47:29,745 --> 01:47:31,583
And we made a life.

1224
01:47:31,608 --> 01:47:36,129
A beautiful life... together.

1225
01:47:39,454 --> 01:47:44,642
