00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,812
Good afternoon, Miss Ocean.

4
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:32,845
Hi.

5
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:35,582
As you know,
parole is a privilege.

6
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,318
And one of the restrictions
on any parolee,

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,852
is to avoid the company

8
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:42,922
of any person who has
a criminal record of any kind.

9
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:45,092
That would include
most of your extended family.

10
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:47,994
Yeah, that's obviously
not something I'm proud of.

11
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:51,330
Would this pose an impossible
challenge for you?

12
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:52,766
No. No.

13
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:56,169
I don't want that life.
I never wanted that life.

14
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:58,037
My brother, um...

15
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,339
May he rest in peace,

16
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:01,474
was a criminal.

17
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:03,277
I loved him,

18
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:04,577
but he was a conman.

19
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:05,845
It was in his blood.

20
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:07,713
- And it's not in your blood?
- No.

21
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:09,249
No, sir.

22
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,785
Um...

23
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:13,523
I fell for the wrong person.

24
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:15,922
It was a mistake.

25
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:17,190
Uh...

26
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:18,727
But it happened.

27
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:22,799
And if I were to be released,
I would, um...

28
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:28,469
Sorry.

29
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,603
Wow, just saying that...

30
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,642
If I were to be released,

31
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,877
I would just want
the simple life.

32
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,213
I just wanna hold down a job,

33
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,749
make some friends,

34
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,921
go for a walk after work
in the fresh air

35
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:49,856
and pay my bills.

36
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,508
Simple life?

37
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,675
Nice one.

38
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:11,443
- Heard about that?
- Who didn't?

39
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,647
I had five years
to rehearse it.

40
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:16,551
- Here's your stuff.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,322
Nice watch.

42
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:24,124
- It's my brother's.
- Left it to you?

43
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,758
I stole it.

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,095
It's fine, Dina.
He stole it, too.

45
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:30,162
So we're still gonna get
a regular shipment next week.

46
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:33,066
You take your cut, plus
a few extra cartons, okay?

47
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:35,768
I want you to trade 'em,
not smoke 'em.

48
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,603
<i>So where you going?</i>

49
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:40,608
<i>Well, I have 45 bucks, Dina.</i>

50
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,545
<i>I can go anywhere I want.</i>

51
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,645
Hi, I'd like to return these.

52
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:54,179
Oh, of course.
Do you have your receipt?

53
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:56,216
No, but they're unopened.
They haven't been touched.

54
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:58,050
I really need your receipt.

55
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:00,153
They are sealed.
They are brand new.

56
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,022
Do you have
the credit card that you used?

57
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:04,524
This is ridiculous!
I bought these last week.

58
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,393
Ma'am, you can try client
services on the sixth floor.

59
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:09,363
You know what? Never mind.
I'll just keep 'em.

60
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:10,797
Jesus.

61
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,233
Can I at least get a bag?

62
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,236
Sure.

63
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:17,673
Thank you.

64
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:30,950
Hi. I'm checking out
of room 2814. Gary Randall.

65
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:33,088
- Did you have a pleasant stay?
- Terrific.

66
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:35,921
My name is Monica.

67
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,223
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

68
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,358
Or arrange transportation?

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,594
I think we're all set.

70
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,195
<i>Hi,
this is Mrs. Randall.</i>

71
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:43,930
<i>We just checked out
of room 2814.</i>

72
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:45,531
<i>May I speak
with Monica, please?</i>

73
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,233
- <i>This is she.</i>
- Hi, Monica.

74
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:48,401
- Hi.
- Hi.

75
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:51,370
Uh, we just found out
our flight was canceled.

76
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,772
- Oh, no!
- I know, I know.

77
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:54,974
And instead of staying

78
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:56,476
in some
horrible airport hotel,

79
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:57,745
we were hoping that maybe

80
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,346
we could get
our original room back?

81
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:01,214
Yeah, we can give you
that same room back.

82
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:04,118
That would be amazing!
Thank you so much!

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,620
<i>Um, we're just
gonna go grab a bite.</i>

84
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:08,721
<i>Would it be possible
to get the maid in there now?</i>

85
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:10,055
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

86
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:11,992
<i>Perfect.
We really appreciate it.</i>

87
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:13,493
<i>It's not a problem.</i>

88
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:14,997
<i>Thank you so much.
We'll see you soon.</i>

89
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,740
Hi.

90
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,108
I'm so sorry.
Can you finish up later?

91
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,510
I just have
to get off my feet.

92
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:31,978
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

93
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,413
- Have a great day.
- You, too!

94
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,051
Bye-bye.

95
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:15,055
<i>And he did not move in!</i>

96
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:16,723
<i>And he wants his money back.</i>

97
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,625
<i>And he gets his money back.</i>

98
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:22,027
<i>If you said no, does that mean
you didn't take the money?</i>

99
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,695
What crate are you on?

100
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:24,899
15.

101
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,099
<i>Listen.</i>

102
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:28,601
<i>You think I like you?
You think I believe you?</i>

103
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:30,603
<i>You think I trust anything
that you're saying?</i>

104
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,673
<i>The answer is absolutely not.</i>

105
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:34,742
Guys, it's 9:30.

106
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,613
It's too much.
It's too much.

107
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:42,481
It's three fingers
from the top.

108
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:44,817
Not one, it's three.

109
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,719
It's a rerun, April.

110
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,887
She slept with her cousin,
crashed the car.

111
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:50,589
The baby's not his.

112
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:52,260
What's that taste like?

113
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,993
Vodka.

114
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:57,531
Vodka. Exactly.
But I don't want vodka.

115
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,832
I want vodka and water.

116
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,301
- And do you wanna know why?
- Uh, sure.

117
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:05,137
'Cause when you're drunk,
it tastes like vodka.

118
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,043
- Right.
- Right.

119
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:10,676
<i>I don't care!</i>

120
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,744
Oh, missed you, too.

121
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,562
You better be in there.

122
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:08,567
I know you're there, Reuben.

123
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:09,771
You can come on out.

124
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,976
I was just paying my respects.

125
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,413
From around the corner?

126
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,012
What are you doing here?

127
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:22,682
They thought I'd be
the best one to talk to you.

128
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:25,084
Hmm. Gotta go.

129
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:28,087
He didn't want you
to do this, Deborah.

130
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,322
Do what?

131
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,490
Whatever it is he wouldn't
tell us you're gonna do.

132
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:32,993
- Look, Deb.
- Mmm.

133
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:36,729
Sometimes, just knowing
the job will work

134
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:39,364
is satisfaction enough.

135
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:42,036
You don't actually
gotta do it.

136
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:46,839
What else did he say?

137
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:49,175
- He said it was brilliant.
- Oh, okay.

138
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:52,145
And that you would probably
end up back in prison.

139
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:54,483
I'm not gonna end up
back in prison.

140
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,650
Okay?

141
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,290
I gotta go.

142
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:06,124
Be careful.

143
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,561
You're looking sharp.

144
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,877
- Mmm!
- Hey, hey! Take it easy.

145
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,179
Been in the slammer.

146
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:27,950
Oh, I just thought
you changed your number.

147
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,916
Did you
get the credit line?

148
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:33,853
- Not yet.
- Why not?

149
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:35,921
Because I don't know
what it's for.

150
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:37,123
Oh, my God!

151
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,592
Don't do that.

152
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:40,660
Do what?

153
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,162
That would be my "I've just
been in jail for five years,

154
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:44,397
"and my partner
lets me down" face.

155
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,870
Hey, I'm not your partner.
Yet.

156
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:50,869
This is nice.

157
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:53,573
Chain-link, barb wire.

158
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:55,144
Brought you something.

159
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,278
Oh, um...

160
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,446
Can I exchange
something you stole?

161
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,181
Well, if you're gonna
have a problem with stealing,

162
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:05,017
you're not gonna like
the rest of this conversation.

163
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,953
- What, we're gonna shoplift?
- Maybe.

164
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:08,354
No. See, this is what you do.

165
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:10,355
You make me guess and then,
I'm interested.

166
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:12,059
- Okay.
- And then you think because

167
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,459
I'm interested,
that I wanna do it.

168
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:15,228
Don't you wanna do things
you're interested in?

169
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,528
I'm interested
in brain surgery.

170
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,364
Well, we know
that's not gonna happen.

171
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,266
Whatever.
You don't wanna tell me...

172
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,504
It's jewels.

173
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,806
Spectacular,
great, big, blingy,

174
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:29,307
big old Liz Taylor jewels,

175
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:32,548
that are locked in a vault
50 feet underground.

176
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,983
How do we get them
out of the vault?

177
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,020
They're gonna bring 'em to us.

178
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:43,225
Oh, bugger!

179
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,627
Oh.

180
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:49,027
Nice place.

181
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:50,530
Try heating it.

182
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,965
There's a room
for you upstairs.

183
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,868
Your stuff's upstairs, too.

184
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,369
You know,
I borrowed some shit.

185
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:59,474
Figured you weren't using it.

186
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:34,141
So,
is this your gallery?

187
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:35,206
- Yeah, one of them.
- Hmm.

188
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,975
Where are the others?

189
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:38,344
Well, I'm opening
one in London.

190
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:39,979
Got plans
for another one in Tokyo.

191
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,080
We're talking about LA,

192
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,449
but I'm not sure
that makes sense.

193
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,849
It's all a bit derivative
out there, you know?

194
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,984
So this is
the only one that exists?

195
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:48,490
Well... Physically.

196
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,429
Excuse me one second.

197
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:55,563
Sorry. Sorry.

198
00:11:57,831 --> 00:11:59,701
Oh, my God.

199
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:03,369
I was meaning to call you.

200
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:06,372
Jesus, it's great to see you.
You look...

201
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:07,906
Recently incarcerated?

202
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:10,475
Wonderful. You look wonderful.

203
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:12,210
Do you know what a shiv is?

204
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:14,647
Okay, stop. Just stop.

205
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,985
Oh, such a nice face.

206
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,118
You know, inside,

207
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,188
you're what we call
a pretty girl.

208
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,358
- I'll call the police.
- Okay.

209
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,028
Do you know what we do
with snitches?

210
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:33,132
- <i>He saw you?</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

211
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,069
<i>Why would you
do something like that?</i>

212
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:37,771
Closure?

213
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,008
Bullshit!

214
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:42,975
Jesus!

215
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:46,280
So did you...

216
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,414
No.

217
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,848
Just a little button.

218
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:09,536
<i>So at first, I thought
banks. 'Cause you know...</i>

219
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,903
<i>That's where
they have money?</i>

220
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:12,939
<i>Exactly.
But that's kind of boring.</i>

221
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:15,242
So then I thought ten banks.

222
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:16,642
Then I realized
that would be maybe

223
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:18,177
coming from
an angry place so...

224
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,646
Good you realized that.

225
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,546
Yes. Then I couldn't
even hear myself think.

226
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,715
You know,
five women in one cell.

227
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:25,450
So I got myself
thrown in solitary

228
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:27,587
for a little peace and quiet,

229
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,092
and that's where
I finally came up with it.

230
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:01,887
- It's still a museum.
- So?

231
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,190
So, it's not like
robbing a liquor store.

232
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:09,128
I'm sorry,
I don't speak Ukrainian.

233
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,829
I said, "We're
not robbing a museum."

234
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:12,831
We're robbing someone
in a museum.

235
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,199
In a museum.

236
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,768
Yeah, you mentioned.

237
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,237
Look.

238
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,939
- Even if this was possible...
- It is possible.

239
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:21,840
Even if it was,
we'd need, like,

240
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:24,109
20 people
and half a million dollars.

241
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:25,243
Seven.

242
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:26,378
Seven million?

243
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,182
Seven people and 20 grand.

244
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,584
Why do you need to do this?

245
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:34,720
Because it's what I'm good at.

246
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:36,724
Uh, yeah.

247
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,691
You know what?

248
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:41,161
I have run this thing
a thousand times.

249
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:42,896
Every time I got caught,
I fixed it.

250
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,696
And in three years, I wasn't
getting caught anymore.

251
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:47,599
By the time I was paroled,
it was running like clockwork.

252
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:49,368
Perfectly.

253
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,338
And you were there with me,
every step of the way.

254
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,239
Oh, honey, is this a proposal?

255
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,876
Baby, I don't have
a diamond yet.

256
00:14:56,878 --> 00:14:58,511
Come on. Do you
really wanna spend the rest

257
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:00,146
of your life
watering down well vodka?

258
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:02,451
Because it's really
kind of a waste.

259
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:06,185
Come on. Take a bite.

260
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:08,257
Just take a bite.

261
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:11,659
- You're really irritating.
- Open.

262
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,362
That's good.

263
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:17,865
Very good.

264
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
<i>So each year they host</i>

265
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:23,736
<i>the biggest party
in the world.</i>

266
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:26,272
<i>And they always get
a huge celebrity to host.</i>

267
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:27,739
<i>This year, it's Daphne Kluger.</i>

268
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:29,242
<i>Wow!</i>

269
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:30,609
<i>Yeah.
But she's not our mark.</i>

270
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:31,810
<i>So who's the mark?</i>

271
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:34,348
All right,
who wants to go first?

272
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:36,181
Yes.

273
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:37,617
Do you know
who you're wearing?

274
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:38,917
Uh, ooh...

275
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,353
La Perla. It's black.

276
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:42,655
No, I mean who's dressing you?

277
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:44,456
I don't really
know yet.

278
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,191
The designer.

279
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:48,161
I don't know yet.

280
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,661
But as soon as I do,

281
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:51,864
you'll be the very first
person that I tell.

282
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,801
Uh, next question?

283
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:57,070
<i>All right,
we need a designer.</i>

284
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,338
<i>Exactly!</i>

285
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,638
Now a lot of these
we could target.

286
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,873
But Anna won't approve them,

287
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,407
and Anna
has to approve everything.

288
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,743
I know.

289
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,411
There's a few
less-established choices,

290
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:06,912
but they're not gonna
give us the juice we need.

291
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:07,915
So...

292
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,449
Rose Weil.
Why do I know that name?

293
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:13,386
Well, she was big,
in the '90s.

294
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,720
Oh, God, all the Edwardian
collars and the ruffles.

295
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:17,890
Travesty.
But Anna still likes her.

296
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:20,459
They do Easter together
every year in Kent.

297
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:21,661
- Brits?
- Irish.

298
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:25,466
And she owes the IRS
$5 million.

299
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:30,669
<i>It's bad.</i>

300
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:31,938
<i>There's a lien on her assets,</i>

301
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,138
<i>they've impounded
her passport.</i>

302
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,674
<i>The bank seized her townhouse.</i>

303
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,175
<i>She sounds amazing.</i>

304
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:37,276
<i>Yeah.</i>

305
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,545
<i>I think we got lucky.</i>

306
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:41,747
<i>She gambled
everything on this.</i>

307
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:45,184
This is a flight to
nowhere without any peanuts.

308
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:48,653
Self-financed.
Credit from an Omaha bank.

309
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:50,022
Those guys over there?

310
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:52,291
The only ones
who'll still loan her money.

311
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:54,893
They look a little worried.

312
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:57,832
Yeah, who can blame them?
This is a train wreck.

313
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:20,888
Congratulations.

314
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,257
Who are you?

315
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,391
Big fans.

316
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:27,492
- Very big.
- Oh.

317
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,261
- That was...
- Just...

318
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:31,096
- Gorgeous.
- Mmm-hmm.

319
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:32,768
No, it wasn't.

320
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,434
It was a disaster.

321
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:38,336
I think you're being
kind of hard on yourself.

322
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:39,572
Very.

323
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:42,342
Did you read this?

324
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,209
It's by a blogger.

325
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:45,681
Mmm.

326
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:49,415
"Rose Weil.

327
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,218
"Her new collection
is like taking a tour

328
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,719
"of your grandmother's closet.

329
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:56,488
"Just as dated,
and just as musty.

330
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,392
"The Eskimo shove their
elders out on an ice floe.

331
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:00,492
"Just saying."

332
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:02,261
That's very cruel.

333
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:04,229
But it doesn't make it true.

334
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,097
Mmm.

335
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,632
How did I get here?

336
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,902
You spent $18 million
in two years

337
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,873
and had two houseboats
on the Seine.

338
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,672
I'm old.

339
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,574
Hey, you're not old.

340
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:18,643
I'm old,
and I'm going to prison.

341
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:21,247
Then I'm going to be
really, really poor.

342
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,382
Not necessarily.

343
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:27,187
What if we could
make all this go away?

344
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,691
Even get your passport back.

345
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:34,526
How?

346
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,865
Dress Daphne Kluger
for the Met Ball.

347
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,199
Mmm.

348
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:41,834
Are you mad?

349
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:43,236
Mmm-mmm.

350
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:44,639
No, hang on a minute.

351
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,873
Are you journalists?

352
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,741
- Absolutely not.
- God, no.

353
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:49,941
Uh-uh.

354
00:18:49,943 --> 00:18:54,780
- Hmm. She seems sort of tense.
- Can be.

355
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:59,117
Good body. Good boobs.
Huge features.

356
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,885
Eyes like Bambi.

357
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,788
Yeah. She can take
quite a lot.

358
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,558
Maybe we could give her...
Maybe...

359
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,129
Maybe we could give her this.

360
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:13,532
God, no. Not chic.
We can do better than that.

361
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:16,169
It's called the Toussaint.

362
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,536
Named for Jeanne Toussaint,

363
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:20,405
Cartier's director of jewelry
from '33 to '68.

364
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,941
It's over six pounds
of diamonds.

365
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:24,075
Right.

366
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:26,144
After she died, they sold it
back to Cartier,

367
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:28,815
and they've kept it
in their vault ever since.

368
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,615
- They've never let it out.
- Mmm-hmm.

369
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:33,018
So then, how are we
gonna get it out?

370
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,424
Well, they might
let it out for her.

371
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,926
The theme of this year's ball

372
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:42,394
is European royalty...

373
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:45,498
...of which the crown jewels
are a featured element.

374
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,768
So, if you were to insist
on the Toussaint

375
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,973
on behalf of Daphne Kluger...

376
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,481
Must be worth
quite a lot.

377
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,784
Yeah.

378
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,785
- These are all Russians.
- They're hackers.

379
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:08,286
Are there no hackers
who aren't Russian?

380
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:10,956
No, there's barely any
Russians who aren't hackers.

381
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,162
- Just keep looking, please.
- Sure.

382
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:44,657
Okay.

383
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:02,274
Sorry about Danny.

384
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:04,846
Sorry about your pops.

385
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:08,747
So, what are you doing here?

386
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:11,183
I might have
something for you.

387
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:12,285
A job.

388
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,452
You wanna run some stuff
through the store?

389
00:21:14,454 --> 00:21:16,221
No, thank you.

390
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:17,725
A little more than that.

391
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,926
How long would it take you

392
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,161
to make
seven pieces of jewelry,

393
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:24,529
if the stones
were already cut?

394
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:27,269
Probably five or six hours.

395
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:30,469
How long if I told you
you didn't have to

396
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:31,772
live with your mother anymore?

397
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,276
Less.

398
00:21:38,211 --> 00:21:40,278
I'm never taking
the F-train again.

399
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:43,481
She's in.

400
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:45,316
She is in where?

401
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:47,786
This what you talking about?
Bunch of vases.

402
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:49,324
Yeah,
that's the Egyptian wing.

403
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:51,457
She's in the Met?

404
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:53,324
Security cameras.

405
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:55,163
There's a lot of 'em.

406
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:57,196
My name's Debbie.

407
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,632
- Nine Ball.
- What's your real name?

408
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:00,699
Eight Ball.

409
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:01,933
We use real names around here.

410
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,904
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

411
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,507
I asked you
to get me a hacker.

412
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,107
She is one of the best hackers
on the East Coast.

413
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:10,642
- Oh, I'm honored...
- She has other clients.

414
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:11,943
They don't know
her real name either.

415
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:13,511
I'm sorry, "other clients"?

416
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:14,881
- Now?
- Yeah.

417
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:17,815
Did you tell her
what her cut was?

418
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:19,954
- Of course.
- And?

419
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,963
Look. She's smoking!

420
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:34,700
So, Nine Ball.

421
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:38,469
Uh, do I call you
Nine Ball? Nine...

422
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,107
Or Baller.

423
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,177
Baller? Okay. Okay.

424
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,276
Uh-oh.

425
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:47,646
You know your footprint
is a disaster, right?

426
00:22:47,648 --> 00:22:50,816
- I'm sorry, what?
- Your footprint.

427
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:53,151
- My footprint?
- Yes, ma'am.

428
00:22:53,153 --> 00:22:54,621
If you're planning
to steal shit,

429
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,121
you definitely
got to clean this up,

430
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:59,158
'cause right now, my
little sister could hack you.

431
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,896
Oh, right.
'Cause we had this guy...

432
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,867
Gotcha.

433
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:12,139
We'll clean that up.

434
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,843
- Can I ask where we're going?
- You'll see in a minute.

435
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,378
Right, we're going to meet

436
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,612
- Doris Kluger...
- Daphne.

437
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:22,113
- Daphne.
- Someone even more famous.

438
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,115
Someone who makes
Daphne Kluger jealous.

439
00:23:24,117 --> 00:23:25,854
- Jealous?
- Hmm.

440
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:28,653
In a minute,
we're gonna stand up.

441
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:29,921
She's gonna sit down.

442
00:23:29,923 --> 00:23:31,657
You'll recognize her.
Just be cool.

443
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:32,958
- Aloof.
- But kind.

444
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,128
- But not too kind.
- Yeah.

445
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,161
You're sweating.

446
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:38,029
- Yeah, look, I sweat.
- Don't.

447
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,265
On her left hand is a tattoo.

448
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,600
I want you to take it,
admire it,

449
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:44,503
but make physical contact,
and that's when we'll get it.

450
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:46,107
"It"? What's "it"?

451
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:54,282
Hi. Wow.

452
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:56,782
Oh, I know you!

453
00:23:56,784 --> 00:23:59,651
Yes, I know you. I've seen
you. I've seen you in things.

454
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,253
Yeah.

455
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:02,755
- No, you're good.
- Oh, thank you.

456
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:05,056
- You're really good. Yeah.
- Thank you.

457
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:06,557
Well, I just really wanted
to say, "Thank you."

458
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,992
Thank you?

459
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:11,031
For helping us with
the feline rescue project.

460
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,869
Penelope Stern?

461
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:19,103
Is she even old enough
to go to the Met Ball?

462
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:20,373
Apparently.

463
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,972
Who cares
who's dressing her anyway?

464
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,878
Uh, I think Page Six.

465
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:32,250
I never met with Rose Weil.
You said I met with everybody.

466
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:35,120
- You said she was a relic.
- I meant iconic.

467
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:37,390
Do you want me
to set up a meeting?

468
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:41,028
- Yes!
- Okay.

469
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:47,499
<i>I watched
one of her films last night.</i>

470
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:49,035
<i>She's actually really good.</i>

471
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:50,901
<i>Whatever you do,
don't fawn.</i>

472
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:52,270
<i>Just ignore her.</i>

473
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:53,773
<i>Indifference,
it's an aphrodisiac.</i>

474
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:54,974
<i>Very little
eye contact.</i>

475
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:56,441
- Rose.
- Oh.

476
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:59,611
- Daphne. Miss Kluger.
- Finally.

477
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:03,615
So, thank you so much
for meeting me so last minute.

478
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:07,121
I am such an admirer of yours.
I have so many of your pieces.

479
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:11,590
- Really?
- Yeah.

480
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:14,793
So, this search...
It has not been easy.

481
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:16,295
And everything we've seen,

482
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:18,564
- you know, it's been great.
- Mmm-hmm.

483
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:21,199
But it's been tired

484
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,101
and you seem different.

485
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:26,374
You know, like
you're immune to judgment.

486
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:32,046
Like you're above all that.

487
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,281
I'm sorry, what?

488
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:40,318
What is going on?

489
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,286
Uh...

490
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:43,121
Oh, sorry.

491
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:45,324
Um, what were you saying?

492
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:48,529
I'm trying to hire you
for the Met Ball.

493
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:53,101
Great. Thank you. My honor.

494
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,068
Flattered.

495
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:59,136
Wait till you see.

496
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:01,373
This girl has some of the best
hands I've ever seen.

497
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,308
Is this one sane?

498
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,143
Hundred percent.

499
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:06,577
All right, here's how
we're playing.

500
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:07,912
Red is money, okay?

501
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,282
Really? Three-card Monte?

502
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:12,217
Follow the Queen,
live your dream.

503
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:14,586
But don't sleep. Don't sleep.

504
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:16,456
'Cause she might disappear,
you saw that?

505
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:18,591
It's lit, right?

506
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,292
She came back, though.
She likes you.

507
00:26:20,294 --> 00:26:23,362
All right, let's hit it.
And we're following the Queen.

508
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:26,164
And we're following the Queen.

509
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,432
Is this our only choice?

510
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:29,367
The turnover
in pickpockets is huge.

511
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:31,870
Where she at?
Where that bitch at?

512
00:26:31,872 --> 00:26:33,206
Where she at?

513
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,209
That one.

514
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,776
Wanna call a lifeline
on that one?

515
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:40,613
No. That one.

516
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:43,915
All right. That one is mine.

517
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,718
Come on,
there's no hard feelings.

518
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,986
And you're a real one, you
know? You know what I mean?

519
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:50,756
Yeah, come back any time.

520
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:53,491
- Not bad.
- Yeah. I thought so.

521
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:58,063
Turkey and provolone, please.

522
00:26:58,065 --> 00:27:00,265
So, I'm lifting one necklace.

523
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:01,499
It's a very nice necklace.

524
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:03,070
Uh, lettuce and tomato.

525
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:07,875
- And this is legit, the money?
- Hundred percent.

526
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:11,545
- Okay, I'm in.
- Great.

527
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,983
Uh, can I get
my watch back, please?

528
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:24,592
Thank you. And hers as well.

529
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:27,192
No, I...

530
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:29,297
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

531
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,298
<i>Who do we have,
who do we have?</i>

532
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,134
- What about Ivy?
- No, still in jail.

533
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:37,835
- Really?
- What about him?

534
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:39,004
- Well, he's a him.
- So?

535
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:40,305
Don't want a him.

536
00:27:40,307 --> 00:27:41,206
Because it's a him
or because it's a "him"?

537
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,641
No, he's not a "him."

538
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:44,176
- I barely know the guy.
- What's wrong with a him?

539
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:45,611
A him gets noticed,
a her gets ignored,

540
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:47,746
and for once,
we wanna be ignored.

541
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:49,148
What about Tammy?

542
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:04,830
Hey, buddy,

543
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:07,332
can you do me a favor?
Can you take that outside?

544
00:28:17,412 --> 00:28:19,411
Debbie, I am with my family.

545
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:20,682
- I told you...
- <i>I'm outside.</i>

546
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:23,849
- What?
- <i>I'm in your garage.</i>

547
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:29,257
- Deb?
- Hmm?

548
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:34,793
Deb, what are you doing here?
I thought you were in jail.

549
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:37,161
Mmm. I got out.

550
00:28:37,163 --> 00:28:40,600
Look at all this.
Thought you retired?

551
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:42,567
I did.

552
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:45,237
Not as exciting
as hijacking trucks

553
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:47,373
that are smuggling dishwashers
from Canada, right?

554
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,141
Yeah, well,
I don't do that anymore.

555
00:28:49,143 --> 00:28:50,441
But you were
so very good at it.

556
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:52,277
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

557
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,412
So these are all
for personal use, right?

558
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:58,084
- What do you want?
- Just wanna reconnect.

559
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,017
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

560
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,286
- Reconnect?
- Mmm-hmm.

561
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:04,055
You're not bored out here,
are you, Tam-Tam?

562
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:07,058
No, I'm not bored
out here at all.

563
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,727
- Good, good.
- No.

564
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:13,398
- Why would you ask that?
- Because I need a fence.

565
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,500
Well, I told you I don't do
that anymore. I'm out.

566
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:18,269
- It's a big job.
- I don't care.

567
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,705
Do you want me to tell you
how big a job it is?

568
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:21,338
No. No, I really don't.

569
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,508
I think I'm gonna tell you
how big the job is.

570
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:30,315
- Are you kidding?
- No.

571
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:32,551
- Mommy, when's dinner ready?
- Shit!

572
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,686
Uh, sweetheart,
I will be right there.

573
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:36,955
I'm so sorry.
Mommy will be right there.

574
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:38,757
But I'm hungry!

575
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,329
I know, sweetheart, I promise,
I will be right there.

576
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:48,368
- Thanks a lot.
- She sounds sweet.

577
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:54,174
How do you explain all this
to your husband?

578
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:57,345
eBay.

579
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:18,532
Okay, everybody.
Let's get started.

580
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:29,908
We would like
to present to you all

581
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,643
with a hypothetical situation.

582
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:35,580
- How hypothetical?
- Not very, unless we screw up.

583
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:38,616
$16.5 million in each of
your bank accounts,

584
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:40,218
five weeks from now.

585
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,023
In three and a half weeks,

586
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,757
the Met will be
hosting its annual ball,

587
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,259
celebrating
its new costume exhibit,

588
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:49,861
and we are going to rob it.

589
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:51,596
Not the ball itself,

590
00:30:51,598 --> 00:30:53,399
but a very important
set of diamonds

591
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:54,533
that will be
attending the ball.

592
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:57,302
On the neck of Daphne Kluger.

593
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:58,703
Who Rose will be dressing.

594
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:01,472
- The Toussaint?
- Very good.

595
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:03,709
Once Daphne
is inadvertently onboard,

596
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:06,009
we can then get the necklace
out of the Cartier vault,

597
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,947
hack the Met security system,
thank you, Nine Ball,

598
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:10,414
and infiltrate the Gala,

599
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,450
considered to be
one of the most exclusive...

600
00:31:12,452 --> 00:31:14,486
The most exclusive.

601
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:18,724
The most exclusive
party invitation in America.

602
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:21,226
So go home,
get your affairs in order,

603
00:31:21,228 --> 00:31:23,295
because tomorrow,
we begin pulling off

604
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:26,867
one of the biggest
jewelry heists in history.

605
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:38,375
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the big city.

606
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:40,845
- How long?
- Uh, not too long, I promise.

607
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:42,750
I'll be back
before you know it.

608
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:45,351
What are you gonna do?

609
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:48,819
I am going to help my friend
Debbie with her job.

610
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:50,455
What kind of job?

611
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:52,591
- It's complicated.
- Can I come with you?

612
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:57,296
No, sweetie, this is Mommy's
very special work trip.

613
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,530
It is my account,
it is my money,

614
00:31:59,532 --> 00:32:00,998
and the only reason
I can't access it

615
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,867
is because I cannot remember
the make and model

616
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:04,536
of my second cousin's
first car.

617
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:06,604
So if you could just...

618
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:08,405
I don't wanna
make a withdrawal,

619
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:10,644
I would like
to make a deposit.

620
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:13,144
Yes, I...

621
00:32:13,146 --> 00:32:14,979
Hey, can I...

622
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:19,517
Exactly, yes. Yes, I'll hold.
What's up?

623
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,520
Oh, hey, I was wondering
if I can get a MetroCard,

624
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:25,856
'cause I'm skateboarding in
from Queens every day.

625
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:28,293
Can I get a MetroCard?

626
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:29,995
I don't have a MetroCard.

627
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:31,261
You don't have a MetroCard?

628
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:32,497
I don't have a MetroCard.

629
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,164
What are you, a tourist?

630
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,636
You're fascinating.

631
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:40,104
You're gonna just
throw me one dub

632
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:41,506
for a MetroCard? That's it?

633
00:32:41,508 --> 00:32:43,909
How about this?
We steal $50 million,

634
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:46,312
I'll buy everybody MetroCards.
How's that?

635
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:47,515
Okay.

636
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:52,316
- Is that your brother?
- Mmm-hmm.

637
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:53,719
- He's hot.
- Mmm.

638
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,286
You sure
he's dead or...

639
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:56,523
No.

640
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:03,194
Yes, sweetie,
Mommy is in her new job now.

641
00:33:03,196 --> 00:33:04,261
Charlie,
will you do me a favor?

642
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:05,930
Can you put that right there?

643
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:07,832
What, sweetheart?

644
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:09,503
Um, uh, well...

645
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,403
Mommy finds very special toys,

646
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:15,739
and then she finds
new homes for them.

647
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:19,643
Yes, exactly like your turtle.
That is exactly right.

648
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:22,412
Thank you so
much, Charlie, thank you.

649
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:23,815
Sweetheart, I have to go.

650
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:25,549
I just got a brand new
toy for Debbie,

651
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,218
and I can't wait
to play with it.

652
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,534
Zirconium.

653
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:44,067
- I like it.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

654
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:45,237
Unhand the man.

655
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:47,405
Thank you very much.

656
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:49,874
Here are your
very special glasses.

657
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:53,778
If Rose can pull this off,
and that is a very big "if",

658
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,215
these glasses
will scan the real necklace

659
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:59,418
and send a digital print
back to us here.

660
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,052
Once we have that,

661
00:34:01,054 --> 00:34:02,388
this thing will print

662
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,457
a replica
of the necklace in zirconium.

663
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:35,420
- Where is it?
- These are not the Toussaint.

664
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:38,289
We thought you might
want to see these first.

665
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,691
Right. What for?

666
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:45,396
There are certain logistical
problems with that necklace.

667
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,331
We wouldn't even know
how to insure it.

668
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:51,068
All right.

669
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,470
"We were
very clear on the phone."

670
00:34:52,472 --> 00:34:53,838
Yes. We were
very clear on the phone.

671
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,008
We are only interested
in the Toussaint.

672
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,443
Yeah.

673
00:34:57,445 --> 00:35:01,882
Well, then, that would have to
be a much longer discussion.

674
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:10,889
That necklace is valued at
over $150 million.

675
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:13,425
Well, I'm not really
a numbers person.

676
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:16,094
It would require
its own security team,

677
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,561
a new insurance policy.

678
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:19,731
I'm sure you'll work out
all those details.

679
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,166
Oh,
it's not that simple.

680
00:35:22,168 --> 00:35:24,804
I'm afraid the answer is no.

681
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:27,371
No?

682
00:35:27,373 --> 00:35:28,975
No.

683
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:36,115
Look, can I be frank?

684
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,816
I have always loved Cartier.

685
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:40,952
I think, historically,
this has been

686
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:43,554
the most significant
house in the world.

687
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:46,325
But there is whole generation
out there

688
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,062
who mispronounce your name.

689
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,028
French can be difficult.

690
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:13,554
Oui.

691
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:14,912
Stop it. Stop,

692
00:37:14,914 --> 00:37:16,683
- that doesn't help. Stop.
- Okay, all right. All right.

693
00:37:23,255 --> 00:37:24,757
Mmm.

694
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,729
We're too far underground.
Can't get a signal.

695
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:32,530
Very secure down here, huh?

696
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:34,768
Five feet of solid concrete.

697
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,242
You said you wanted
to see it in the light.

698
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:46,378
You wanted to see
the necklace in the light.

699
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,581
Right!

700
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:50,947
This is light.

701
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:54,251
No, no, no, she means real
light. Natural light, yes.

702
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:57,988
The red carpet happens
while the sun is still out.

703
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,023
Yes, no,

704
00:37:59,025 --> 00:38:01,358
- I'm afraid that's vital.
- It's vital.

705
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,896
Mmm. No, I must have the sun.

706
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:06,999
She must have the sun.

707
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:09,601
- How is this light, Ms. Weil?
- Um...

708
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,740
Yes, I think,
yes, we have the sun.

709
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:15,074
Much better.

710
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:18,645
Mmm.

711
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:24,016
- There it is!
- All right.

712
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:25,085
Hello, sexy.

713
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:44,605
Come on, come on.

714
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,106
Ms. Weil. Is she okay?

715
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:50,742
- She's fine.
- Hmm.

716
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:52,376
She needs to take it in.

717
00:38:52,378 --> 00:38:53,681
This is her process.

718
00:38:57,384 --> 00:38:58,450
It looks really good.

719
00:38:58,452 --> 00:39:00,120
- It's so clear.
- Yeah.

720
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:01,722
Come on.

721
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:10,028
No, okay. You gotta...

722
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,162
No. Yep.

723
00:39:11,164 --> 00:39:12,563
If you are done, Ms. Weil...

724
00:39:12,565 --> 00:39:14,601
...we'd like to...

725
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:16,735
...return this to the vault.

726
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:17,938
<i>Ms. Weil?</i>

727
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,007
Ms. Weil.

728
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,711
Yes!

729
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,047
I'm done.

730
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:34,687
Sweet.

731
00:39:37,623 --> 00:39:38,992
Mmm-hmm.

732
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:44,097
Oh, my God!

733
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:57,008
- Well?
- I don't know.

734
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,043
Well, you don't know
because this is only a muslin.

735
00:39:59,045 --> 00:40:00,811
It's going to be pink,
for a start.

736
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,780
I know it's going to be pink,
but I don't know.

737
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:04,215
Yeah, I feel like
it's the waist.

738
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:05,450
I feel, like, it's just...
And then the bottom.

739
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:06,784
I don't know about the bottom.

740
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:08,119
We can definitely
change the hem.

741
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:09,521
- It's the necklace.
- Oh, no.

742
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:10,588
- It's not the necklace.
- It is the necklace.

743
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,391
It's just messy.

744
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:13,557
No, no, no, it's not messy.

745
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,260
It's messy
'cause it's safety pins.

746
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:16,793
No, you must remember
the diamonds.

747
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:18,262
It's gonna be diamonds.

748
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:20,932
I just feel like I look huge.

749
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:23,367
Hey, Daphne, come here.
Come here. Come here.

750
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:26,871
Listen, deep breath...
Deep breath.

751
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:31,008
Listen, look.

752
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,811
You've got one of the greatest
necks in the world.

753
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:36,313
In fact, you've got
the only neck

754
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:39,316
that could carry
this necklace off.

755
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:43,220
With your neck,
this necklace...

756
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:47,925
You are gonna walk
into that Met Gala,

757
00:40:47,927 --> 00:40:50,196
and you are gonna
light up the sky.

758
00:40:56,135 --> 00:40:58,438
Thank you.

759
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,238
You're welcome.

760
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,608
If you like him,
you go right,

761
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,809
and if you don't...

762
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,077
- I go left.
- Yeah, you go left.

763
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,479
- So...
- Okay, that sounds easy.

764
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:10,180
- So do you like him?
- Ooh. I like him a lot.

765
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:11,514
Okay, why?

766
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:12,883
He looks kind.

767
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:14,318
I'm gonna swipe right.

768
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,387
- Okay. All right.
- Oh, my God!

769
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:17,655
So does that mean...

770
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:18,990
He liked you back!
He likes you, too!

771
00:41:18,992 --> 00:41:20,157
What happens now?
What happens now?

772
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:22,092
- So you can message him.
- Okay.

773
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:24,996
And you can say, maybe,
like, the eggplant emoji,

774
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:27,065
or maybe the girl
that does this.

775
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:19,050
Excuse me.

776
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:20,517
Can you help me
with something?

777
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,586
I think I'm a little lost.

778
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:22,820
Of course, ma'am.

779
00:42:22,822 --> 00:42:24,121
I feel like
I'm going in circles.

780
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:25,757
I came from Egypt
back there,

781
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:27,492
and I'm trying to get
to Oceana.

782
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:28,626
It's a little confusing.

783
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:30,128
You can go down the stairs
to your right,

784
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,195
or you can go back
where you came from,

785
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:32,429
- right down there.
- Okay.

786
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:33,764
It might take
a little bit longer.

787
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:36,469
Excuse me, ma'am.

788
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:49,849
Excuse me. Excuse me.

789
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:58,889
<i>Here's
one for your morning commute.</i>

790
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:00,958
<i>Last night,
political artist Banksy</i>

791
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,193
<i>made a surprise contribution
to the Met.</i>

792
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:03,461
<i>Our founding mothers</i>

793
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:05,030
<i>appeared at the Met
last night.</i>

794
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:06,331
<i>Traffic at 15
after the hour.</i>

795
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,568
<i>Your news, all the time.</i>

796
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:12,769
<i>This is a major
security breach.</i>

797
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:13,972
How is this even possible?

798
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:16,441
He did it at the Tate, too.

799
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:17,708
So you're saying

800
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,543
the system your company
designed for our museum

801
00:43:19,545 --> 00:43:21,880
does nothing to prevent
someone like Banksy...

802
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:23,347
Sir, we're a little
more focused

803
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:25,853
on keeping things in
than keeping things out.

804
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:37,430
Hey! How about an "Excuse me"?

805
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:06,191
Correct me
if I'm wrong.

806
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:07,925
You and your company
are responsible

807
00:44:07,927 --> 00:44:10,028
for monitoring
and safeguarding...

808
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,165
Hey, want me to get the trash?

809
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:13,998
What? No.

810
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,767
You sure? 'Cause you got
a lot here, buddy.

811
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:18,070
Fine. Just hurry it up.

812
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:22,574
The museum's agreement

813
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,275
with your father's company
is very...

814
00:44:24,277 --> 00:44:26,211
- Generous.
- Specific.

815
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:27,677
Have a nice night.

816
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:30,248
The board expects
McCallister Security

817
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,717
to live up to the letter
of that agreement.

818
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,719
<i>We'll do
a full audit of the system</i>

819
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:37,755
<i>and update any part of it
that needs to be changed.</i>

820
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:39,190
<i>What does that mean?</i>

821
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:41,559
- <i>We'll go in and fix it.</i>
- <i>When?</i>

822
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:42,726
<i>Immediately.</i>

823
00:44:42,728 --> 00:44:44,028
<i>So, now that
we've gotten them</i>

824
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,396
to make changes
to their system,

825
00:44:45,398 --> 00:44:47,932
we can make changes, too,
and not be detected.

826
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:49,333
Can you pull up the cameras?

827
00:44:49,335 --> 00:44:51,302
They've got every inch
of this place covered.

828
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:53,871
But here is not where
we're gonna hit it.

829
00:44:53,873 --> 00:44:56,474
We are gonna do it in a spot
they don't even care about.

830
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:57,477
Nine Ball.

831
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:00,311
Now it's a New York State law

832
00:45:00,313 --> 00:45:02,545
that no cameras can be mounted
in a public bathroom.

833
00:45:02,547 --> 00:45:04,981
Apparently,
it's a privacy violation.

834
00:45:04,983 --> 00:45:06,217
Unless you're into that.

835
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:07,550
And once we get
the Toussaint,

836
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:08,686
we are gonna have to
get it out of there

837
00:45:08,688 --> 00:45:09,619
without being detected,

838
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:10,854
and they're gonna go over

839
00:45:10,856 --> 00:45:12,356
their security footage
with a fine-tooth comb,

840
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:15,092
and anyone seen exiting
that bathroom

841
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:16,296
is gonna be a suspect.

842
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:17,961
So...

843
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:19,967
So we get a mule.

844
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,369
Somebody else
is gonna move it for us.

845
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,103
How much space
do you need outside

846
00:45:26,105 --> 00:45:27,206
that bathroom
to plant it on somebody?

847
00:45:28,574 --> 00:45:29,574
I don't know. Nine feet?

848
00:45:29,576 --> 00:45:31,075
And how long
is it gonna take us

849
00:45:31,077 --> 00:45:32,744
to build
a nine-foot blind spot?

850
00:45:32,746 --> 00:45:34,278
- Moving a camera?
- Mmm-hmm.

851
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,550
Bit by bit, 10, 12 days.

852
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:40,650
Great.

853
00:45:40,652 --> 00:45:42,887
How long did it take you
to figure all this out?

854
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:44,956
Mmm...

855
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:48,095
Five years, eight months,
and 12 days.

856
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:50,764
Give or take.

857
00:45:52,798 --> 00:45:54,065
Cartier has hired

858
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,003
the best private security
in the world.

859
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:58,036
Guillermo DeVita

860
00:45:58,038 --> 00:46:00,037
led the pope's security
for 10 years.

861
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:02,173
And as you know,
they've never lost a pope.

862
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:04,575
- Mmm.
- Yuri Eshel, former Mossad

863
00:46:04,577 --> 00:46:08,244
and IDF Special Forces,
elite commando unit.

864
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:10,514
I'm pretty sure
they're assassins.

865
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,983
- Well, it's a nice necklace.
- Yeah.

866
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:16,186
So you can go ahead and just
add them to your list.

867
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:18,021
- What list?
- That list.

868
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:19,625
It's not a list.

869
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:43,083
Okay. Who is he?

870
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:50,257
Hey, boo.

871
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:02,769
Oh, Paul.

872
00:47:52,217 --> 00:47:54,217
You poor thing.

873
00:47:59,257 --> 00:48:00,825
Look at that.

874
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:04,197
Oh!

875
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:11,401
We don't even know
if it is Banksy.

876
00:48:11,403 --> 00:48:12,771
It could be an imitator.

877
00:48:38,063 --> 00:48:39,266
That's all you got?

878
00:49:01,788 --> 00:49:03,289
Sweet!

879
00:49:19,005 --> 00:49:22,606
Good afternoon. <i>Vogue.</i>

880
00:49:22,608 --> 00:49:24,641
Thank you for coming in
so last minute.

881
00:49:24,643 --> 00:49:26,476
Oh, of course.
Thank you for having me.

882
00:49:26,478 --> 00:49:28,445
I guess you heard, we lost
one of our coordinators.

883
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:30,081
Yes, and that sounded awful.

884
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,148
Chiggers.

885
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,682
I know.

886
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:34,918
- What are those anyway?
- It's like a mite, I think.

887
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,521
It burrows into the skin
and lays its eggs inside.

888
00:49:37,523 --> 00:49:39,722
And then they hatch
and they dig their way out.

889
00:49:39,724 --> 00:49:41,961
Apparently, it can last
for weeks.

890
00:49:43,362 --> 00:49:45,662
Well, you certainly
seem qualified.

891
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:46,597
Thank you.

892
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:47,932
Maybe overqualified.

893
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:50,133
Well, how can anyone
be overqualified?

894
00:49:50,135 --> 00:49:52,168
This is the Met Gala
after all.

895
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,707
Gala. Met Gala.

896
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:57,775
- It's Gala.
- Gala.

897
00:49:57,777 --> 00:49:58,842
Is it Gala?

898
00:49:58,844 --> 00:49:59,878
- Yeah.
- Okay.

899
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:04,014
<i>Roger Federer again</i>

900
00:50:04,016 --> 00:50:07,251
<i>one game away
from another championship.</i>

901
00:50:07,253 --> 00:50:09,287
<i>The love for Federer in
this place is just incredible.</i>

902
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:10,490
Anna.

903
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:12,588
Uh, yeah?

904
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,492
You have that interview
for the Met staff position.

905
00:50:14,494 --> 00:50:15,825
- Do it, do it.
- Okay.

906
00:50:15,827 --> 00:50:17,528
<i>You cannot be serious!</i>

907
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,963
<i>A backhand down-the-line win!</i>

908
00:50:18,965 --> 00:50:21,097
We're really short
on desk space,

909
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:22,868
so you'll be down here.

910
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:29,873
This way.

911
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:32,476
- Okay, so here is your desk.
- Thank you.

912
00:50:32,478 --> 00:50:33,610
And Christina
will get you started.

913
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:34,979
Great. Thank you so much.

914
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:36,112
- Have a good day!
- Thanks!

915
00:50:36,114 --> 00:50:37,414
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

916
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:38,749
Was that the bathroom
that we passed?

917
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:40,217
Oh, yes, just down the hall.

918
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:41,454
Thank you.

919
00:51:03,242 --> 00:51:05,141
This is unbelievable.

920
00:51:05,143 --> 00:51:06,309
That's Leo?

921
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:07,577
Leo-Leo?

922
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:09,079
There's only one Leo.

923
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:11,048
Oh, my God! Taylor Swift!

924
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,583
You're so white!

925
00:51:12,585 --> 00:51:14,985
Can't we just go to this?
Do we have to steal stuff?

926
00:51:14,987 --> 00:51:16,287
Yes!

927
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:18,322
- Where is she?
- Table four, 10:00.

928
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:19,523
Straightest shot
to the bathroom

929
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:20,724
without putting her
in Siberia.

930
00:51:20,726 --> 00:51:22,360
There's a blank spot
next to her.

931
00:51:22,362 --> 00:51:23,697
It's for her date.

932
00:51:25,998 --> 00:51:27,298
Who's her date?

933
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,501
I don't know.

934
00:51:30,902 --> 00:51:32,302
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt,

935
00:51:32,304 --> 00:51:33,269
but I've got
the final guest list

936
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:34,338
for the Chairman's Dinner.

937
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,706
Oh, great.

938
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:37,007
You have
all their arrival times?

939
00:51:37,009 --> 00:51:38,242
All their arrival times,

940
00:51:38,244 --> 00:51:41,278
including a few additional
names at the bottom.

941
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,679
Claude Becker?

942
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:44,246
<i>His publicist
was into it.</i>

943
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:45,751
<i>I barely had to ask.</i>

944
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:55,224
Hello.

945
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:56,559
They put me next to you.

946
00:51:56,561 --> 00:51:58,162
Oh, lucky me.

947
00:51:58,164 --> 00:51:59,366
Hello.

948
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:01,033
Claude Becker.

949
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,068
Daphne Kluger.

950
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:17,516
The ego has landed.

951
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:20,586
<i>How did you ever fall
for this schmuck?</i>

952
00:52:21,586 --> 00:52:23,487
Seriously?

953
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:26,490
Lou and I were going through
a rough patch,

954
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:30,293
and I really wanted
a big score of my own.

955
00:52:30,295 --> 00:52:31,628
So he roped you in?

956
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,866
Mmm. Not really.

957
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:38,168
What, told you the truth?

958
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,038
Only way to con a con, right?

959
00:52:48,146 --> 00:52:49,514
<i>B1.</i>

960
00:52:49,516 --> 00:52:50,880
<i>Lou and I were
rigging Bingo</i>

961
00:52:50,882 --> 00:52:53,516
<i>and running cheap cons
at Roulette.</i>

962
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:55,721
<i>Lucky if we made $1,000
a night.</i>

963
00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:00,023
- Bingo!
- Bingo call.

964
00:53:00,025 --> 00:53:02,193
<i>So a friend of mine
set me up with this art dealer</i>

965
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:04,161
<i>and we worked out
a simple little hustle.</i>

966
00:53:04,163 --> 00:53:05,929
- Claude Becker?
- Right through there.

967
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,097
Thank you.

968
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:09,566
Hi. I'm Debbie.

969
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:10,836
- Claude Becker.
- Oh.

970
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:15,738
<i>When somebody
got interested in a piece,</i>

971
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,744
<i>I'd pose as another buyer
and drive up the price.</i>

972
00:53:20,445 --> 00:53:24,683
<i>Money was good and he was
great in the kitchen.</i>

973
00:53:25,617 --> 00:53:28,151
Oh, my God, it's so good.

974
00:53:28,153 --> 00:53:29,452
One day

975
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:32,491
he asked me to pose
as the seller, not the buyer.

976
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,191
What did you do?

977
00:53:34,193 --> 00:53:35,795
Well...

978
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,065
One signature,
half a million dollars.

979
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:48,539
<i>He said it was simple.</i>

980
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,374
<i>I'd hand them the documents,
and they'd slide me a check.</i>

981
00:53:51,376 --> 00:53:54,880
<i>The whole thing would take
a couple minutes, tops.</i>

982
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,322
Sorry we're late.

983
00:54:05,324 --> 00:54:06,856
- Not at all.
- It's okay.

984
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:08,224
- Very nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

985
00:54:08,226 --> 00:54:10,062
- It's a beautiful piece.
- Oh, we just love it!

986
00:54:12,197 --> 00:54:15,199
<i>He was right.
It all happened very quickly.</i>

987
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:16,666
You have a right
to an attorney.

988
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:18,334
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

989
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:21,472
<i>It wasn't my painting.
She brought the picture to me.</i>

990
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:23,539
She had documentation,
signatures.

991
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:25,108
And you two were dating?

992
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,476
What?

993
00:54:26,478 --> 00:54:28,679
Not saying a word.

994
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:29,949
Are you sure?

995
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:35,955
'Cause he's not being quite
as tight-lipped as you are.

996
00:54:38,856 --> 00:54:40,923
Are these your signatures?

997
00:54:40,925 --> 00:54:43,760
Yeah, I will testify.

998
00:54:43,762 --> 00:54:46,295
I was defrauded too, right?

999
00:54:46,297 --> 00:54:47,799
I'll be right outside.

1000
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:18,865
Hey!

1001
00:55:20,132 --> 00:55:22,264
We need to talk.

1002
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:24,467
You better tell me this is not
what I think this is.

1003
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:26,570
What?

1004
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:28,041
Claude Becker.

1005
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:29,943
I didn't do that.

1006
00:55:30,842 --> 00:55:32,709
I'm not a croupier, okay?

1007
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:34,411
Or a tourist with
a bucket of quarters.

1008
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:35,778
Don't con me.

1009
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,947
You do not run a job in a job!

1010
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:40,684
It's not going to matter.

1011
00:55:40,686 --> 00:55:42,186
We are going to get caught.

1012
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:43,356
Stop it. We're not.

1013
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:48,626
Why do you do this?

1014
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:50,059
Why can't you just do a job?

1015
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:51,964
Why does there always
have to be an asterisk?

1016
00:55:53,297 --> 00:55:54,999
You frame him, I walk.

1017
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:56,102
Stop.

1018
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,668
This is just like last time.

1019
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,005
Lou. Lou!

1020
00:56:01,005 --> 00:56:02,405
Lou.

1021
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:04,775
He sent me to jail!

1022
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:07,112
You have no idea
what that's like.

1023
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:15,485
Yeah, well,
he's gonna do it again.

1024
00:56:15,487 --> 00:56:17,190
No, he's not.

1025
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,293
He's not.

1026
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,276
Good. Switching cameras.

1027
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:44,250
Walking towards the bathroom.

1028
00:56:49,722 --> 00:56:51,190
Okay, in the blind spot.

1029
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:58,394
I'm gonna keep walking.

1030
00:56:58,396 --> 00:57:00,229
Nothin'.

1031
00:57:00,231 --> 00:57:01,668
Nothin'.

1032
00:57:02,534 --> 00:57:04,302
Okay, you're right there.

1033
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:15,711
<i>12 feet. Nice job!</i>

1034
00:57:15,713 --> 00:57:17,514
Thank you, Nine Ball.

1035
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:20,351
That easy. Don't mention it.

1036
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,387
What's hard?

1037
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:29,092
- Hey.
- Oh, hi!

1038
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:30,561
Sorry, listen,
I know this really

1039
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:31,862
isn't any of my business...

1040
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:33,028
No, go ahead.

1041
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,563
It's just
a little red flag here.

1042
00:57:34,565 --> 00:57:36,900
But this caterer doesn't have
a nutritional specialist.

1043
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:38,400
- Okay.
- And we're running

1044
00:57:38,402 --> 00:57:39,536
at 20% special meals.

1045
00:57:39,538 --> 00:57:42,572
Vegan, gluten-free,
low sodium, lactose.

1046
00:57:42,574 --> 00:57:44,608
I had a client get sued.

1047
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,041
- Really?
- Yeah.

1048
00:57:46,043 --> 00:57:47,711
I don't think we should wing
any of this stuff.

1049
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:49,612
I think we are short
a staff person.

1050
00:57:49,614 --> 00:57:50,947
We need a nutritionist.

1051
00:57:50,949 --> 00:57:52,615
- <i>I do know someone.</i>
- <i>You do?</i>

1052
00:57:52,617 --> 00:57:53,883
<i>Yeah, and she's great.</i>

1053
00:57:53,885 --> 00:57:55,454
<i>She just moved here
from Australia.</i>

1054
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:02,559
Yes.

1055
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:04,094
<i>Okay. Go.</i>

1056
00:58:04,096 --> 00:58:05,429
Vendor, hallway, hallway.

1057
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:06,396
Past the auditorium.

1058
00:58:06,398 --> 00:58:08,130
Hallway, hallway,
hallway, entry.

1059
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:11,203
Hi, hi! I'm so sorry I'm late.
Traffic was horrible.

1060
00:58:13,905 --> 00:58:15,773
Okay...

1061
00:58:15,775 --> 00:58:18,807
- Amita.
- Thank you.

1062
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:20,346
Constance.

1063
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:22,848
Nine Ball.

1064
00:58:23,514 --> 00:58:24,951
And Lou.

1065
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:27,851
And Rose.

1066
00:58:27,853 --> 00:58:29,251
Thank you.

1067
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:31,757
- And Debbie.
- Thank you.

1068
00:58:34,726 --> 00:58:36,325
<i>Hi, I'm Daphne Kluger,</i>

1069
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:39,463
<i>and this is your sneak peek of
this year's Costume Institute.</i>

1070
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:42,766
This is Dolce
and that's Galliano for Dior.

1071
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:44,767
- And that is McQueen.
- Wow.

1072
00:58:44,769 --> 00:58:46,302
And who's
dressing you tomorrow?

1073
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:48,604
Mmm. Rose Weil.

1074
00:58:48,606 --> 00:58:50,039
- Interesting.
- I know.

1075
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,742
I kind of thought
it was an unexpected choice.

1076
00:58:51,744 --> 00:58:52,943
What's this over here?

1077
00:58:52,945 --> 00:58:54,445
So these are
the crown jewels

1078
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,079
from eight royal families
of Europe.

1079
00:58:57,081 --> 00:58:58,581
Which is probably why
there's a moat.

1080
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,050
- So we can't go over there?
- No. God, no.

1081
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,820
I wish we could. Anyway...

1082
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:05,354
Uh, they are on loan to us
from Dmitri

1083
00:59:05,356 --> 00:59:08,057
Very-Long-Russian-Last-Name
that I can't pronounce.

1084
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:09,758
We hear those aren't
the only jewels

1085
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,894
that'll be on display.

1086
00:59:10,896 --> 00:59:12,628
- Who told you?
- I have sources.

1087
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:15,932
Well, since the cat's
already out of the bag...

1088
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:17,934
Yes, I will be wearing
a necklace

1089
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:20,070
that Cartier has decided
to loan me.

1090
00:59:20,072 --> 00:59:21,403
It's called the Toussaint,

1091
00:59:21,405 --> 00:59:23,238
and it has been in a vault
for 50 years.

1092
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,208
And I'm
just a little excited.

1093
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,411
- Have you tried it on already?
- Maybe.

1094
00:59:27,413 --> 00:59:30,182
- How many carats is it?
- Enough.

1095
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,588
Hey.

1096
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,889
- Hey.
- Hmm?

1097
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:15,157
- Lipstick. What do you think?
- Oh.

1098
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:18,461
Pink. Um, yeah. Barbie.

1099
01:00:18,463 --> 01:00:19,465
In a good way.

1100
01:00:20,431 --> 01:00:21,533
Thank you.

1101
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:29,938
- It's here.
- Right. Finally. Great.

1102
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,374
All right.

1103
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:34,212
- Oh, you haven't seen it.
- No.

1104
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:36,949
- Hello.
- Hello.

1105
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:45,224
Ooh. That's a big box.

1106
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,360
All right.

1107
01:00:56,867 --> 01:00:58,403
Holy crap!

1108
01:00:59,371 --> 01:01:00,470
Should we, uh...

1109
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:01,771
Let's try it on.
See if it fits.

1110
01:01:01,773 --> 01:01:02,905
Okay.

1111
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:04,943
- Can I, uh...
- Sure.

1112
01:01:10,081 --> 01:01:12,715
Wow. That's heavy.

1113
01:01:12,717 --> 01:01:13,883
Really heavy.

1114
01:01:13,885 --> 01:01:16,119
Come to mama.

1115
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:18,688
All right.
It might be a little...

1116
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:21,157
Just a tad cold. Right.

1117
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:22,427
Ooh!

1118
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:25,829
- Oh.
- All right. Okay.

1119
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:28,932
- Oh, wow.
- Let me see. Right.

1120
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:30,534
That goes in.

1121
01:01:30,536 --> 01:01:31,901
Look at you.

1122
01:01:31,903 --> 01:01:33,606
Yep. There.

1123
01:01:34,572 --> 01:01:36,375
- It fits.
- Oh.

1124
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:38,143
All right.

1125
01:01:38,976 --> 01:01:40,378
It fits.

1126
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,445
Right, okay.

1127
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:44,981
We can get it off,
and then we can try the frock.

1128
01:01:44,983 --> 01:01:47,119
- Okay.
- Um... Hang on.

1129
01:01:47,952 --> 01:01:49,219
Oh!

1130
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:51,722
Sorry, you cannot do it.
I have to do it.

1131
01:01:51,724 --> 01:01:53,157
It requires a special magnet.

1132
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:55,258
- What?
- Cool.

1133
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,894
- Uh, special magnet?
- Yes.

1134
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:03,766
- Oh.
- That's cool.

1135
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:06,004
That's brilliant. Brilliant.

1136
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,670
Amazing.

1137
01:02:07,672 --> 01:02:09,240
Um...

1138
01:02:11,043 --> 01:02:14,278
Can I just see that again,
out of interest?

1139
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,682
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1140
01:02:18,516 --> 01:02:19,585
That's amazing.

1141
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:24,854
Great. Let me just see.
So how does it work?

1142
01:02:24,856 --> 01:02:26,190
Hilda Schneider,
fashion reporter, <i>Der Spiegel.</i>

1143
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:27,391
No.

1144
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:28,590
Hilda Schneider,
diplomatic attache?

1145
01:02:28,592 --> 01:02:29,492
No.

1146
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:30,793
- Lufthansa asset?
- Lufthansa.

1147
01:02:30,795 --> 01:02:32,028
Problem.

1148
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,599
- With?
- From Rose.

1149
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,733
Oh, God.

1150
01:02:37,735 --> 01:02:39,034
Come on!

1151
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:40,436
<i>Oh, my God,
that is amazing.</i>

1152
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:41,871
<i>And you can only do it
with a magnet?</i>

1153
01:02:41,873 --> 01:02:43,840
- <i>Only the magnet.</i>
- <i>Let me just see...</i>

1154
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:46,309
Stop. Play it again.

1155
01:02:46,311 --> 01:02:48,110
<i>Oh, my God,
that is amazing.</i>

1156
01:02:48,112 --> 01:02:49,579
<i>And you can only do it
with a magnet?</i>

1157
01:02:49,581 --> 01:02:51,784
- <i>Only the magnet.</i>
- <i>Zoom</i> in a little bit.

1158
01:03:05,463 --> 01:03:07,597
What, Leslie? I'm busy.

1159
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,532
Leslie?

1160
01:03:09,534 --> 01:03:11,800
Hey, sis, we're in a bit of
a jam right now,

1161
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:13,105
and I need your help.

1162
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,476
So it seems like they used
poly-magnets and a spring.

1163
01:03:19,478 --> 01:03:21,510
It gives you attraction
and repulsion

1164
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:23,412
<i>in the same axis, you know?</i>

1165
01:03:23,414 --> 01:03:26,249
- Not really.
- <i>Well, they're drawn together.</i>

1166
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:29,318
But don't touch,
until you rotate it,

1167
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,088
and then they lock.

1168
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,690
It's real dope.
I'll go get you a positive

1169
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:37,461
<i>and a negative pole in a loop.
That oughta work fine.</i>

1170
01:03:37,463 --> 01:03:40,463
You're a little genius, sis.
Thank you.

1171
01:03:40,465 --> 01:03:42,065
Really? She fixed it?

1172
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:43,833
Really?
You just asked me that?

1173
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,215
Okay, you guys. Sound check.

1174
01:03:58,284 --> 01:04:00,682
- Nine Ball.
- Check.

1175
01:04:00,684 --> 01:04:02,117
- Debbie.
- Check.

1176
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:04,119
- Constance.
- Yeah.

1177
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:05,320
- Amita.
- Yep.

1178
01:04:05,322 --> 01:04:07,092
- Lou.
- Check.

1179
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:26,943
That shit was hectic.
Got chased by a cop!

1180
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:30,646
Okay, so this is my sister,
everyone, Veronica.

1181
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:33,518
Check this out. Crazy.

1182
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,920
Tight. All right. I owe you
one, you little shit.

1183
01:04:37,922 --> 01:04:39,621
Just get me a new ID.

1184
01:04:39,623 --> 01:04:41,257
Go home.

1185
01:04:41,259 --> 01:04:43,128
What do your parents do?

1186
01:04:45,963 --> 01:04:48,731
<i>Okay, we are up.
Is everybody on?</i>

1187
01:04:48,733 --> 01:04:50,333
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1188
01:04:50,335 --> 01:04:52,434
All right, ladies.
Half an hour.

1189
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:54,572
Countdown starting now.

1190
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,811
Okay. First.
No need to be nervous.

1191
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,110
The food is better
on the inside

1192
01:05:02,112 --> 01:05:03,412
than most people think

1193
01:05:03,414 --> 01:05:06,349
and even solitary
can be kind of peaceful.

1194
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:17,496
I just wanna say, thank you.

1195
01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:22,733
The last three weeks
have been amazing for me,

1196
01:05:22,735 --> 01:05:25,570
and we've all worked very hard
for this moment.

1197
01:05:26,405 --> 01:05:28,371
So whatever happens tonight,

1198
01:05:28,373 --> 01:05:29,807
I want you to remember
one thing,

1199
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:33,476
you are not doing this for me.

1200
01:05:33,478 --> 01:05:36,412
You are not doing this
for you.

1201
01:05:36,414 --> 01:05:39,548
Somewhere out there is
an eight-year-old girl

1202
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:42,621
lying in bed,
dreaming of being a criminal.

1203
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:47,923
Let's do this for her.

1204
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:50,425
Do not engage
in informal conversation

1205
01:05:50,427 --> 01:05:51,728
with the guests, please.

1206
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,630
Do not have your cell phone
on you.

1207
01:05:53,632 --> 01:05:55,030
Please make sure
your cell phone is turned in

1208
01:05:55,032 --> 01:05:57,066
to security prior to the start
of the event.

1209
01:05:57,068 --> 01:05:58,267
Very important.

1210
01:05:58,269 --> 01:06:00,137
Do not slouch,
cross your arms,

1211
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:01,436
put your hands
in your pockets.

1212
01:06:01,438 --> 01:06:02,539
I know it's gonna be
a long night.

1213
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,606
I know you're gonna get tired.

1214
01:06:20,257 --> 01:06:22,425
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

1215
01:06:22,427 --> 01:06:23,959
Edward, so good to see you.
Claude Becker.

1216
01:06:23,961 --> 01:06:26,362
- Pleasure.
- And, of course, Rose Weil.

1217
01:06:26,364 --> 01:06:28,231
- You two know each other?
- Yes.

1218
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:30,432
My dear,
is that the Toussaint?

1219
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:32,200
I'd say
you look like a million bucks,

1220
01:06:32,202 --> 01:06:33,735
but it's more like
100 million.

1221
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:36,706
Thank you, it's a 150 million
actually.

1222
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:39,378
What inspired you
for tonight's look?

1223
01:06:42,112 --> 01:06:43,348
Her.

1224
01:07:00,264 --> 01:07:03,766
Unreal. So what makes
this such a fun night?

1225
01:07:03,768 --> 01:07:05,501
I mean, you never know
who you're gonna see.

1226
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:08,104
It's stars
from all over the planet.

1227
01:07:08,106 --> 01:07:11,377
Meeting actors, people in
the fashion industry.

1228
01:07:12,643 --> 01:07:15,545
So coming up next,
we have Serena Williams.

1229
01:07:15,547 --> 01:07:18,081
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

1230
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:19,749
I'm good, thank you.

1231
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:21,284
So you've conquered the court,
you've conquered motherhood...

1232
01:07:21,286 --> 01:07:23,686
- I'm trying.
- I mean, you are succeeding.

1233
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:26,555
Sorry, we're a little
backed up today. Your name?

1234
01:07:26,557 --> 01:07:29,391
Uh, Hilda Schneider.

1235
01:07:29,393 --> 01:07:31,293
Oh, here it is.
Have a good night.

1236
01:07:40,271 --> 01:07:41,907
Here, Heidi! Heidi!

1237
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:14,673
Yes. Ready for tonight?

1238
01:08:24,248 --> 01:08:27,019
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to see you! Fantastic.

1239
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:48,006
Ready to sit.

1240
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:55,814
- Hot sauce?
- Hot sauce.

1241
01:09:25,877 --> 01:09:28,514
- You good?
- Yeah. I'll see you soon?

1242
01:09:31,048 --> 01:09:33,519
Hey, no, we're closed.

1243
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,486
We're closed.

1244
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:38,957
Come on, dude.
It's right there.

1245
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:48,567
Yeah, I got her.

1246
01:09:49,134 --> 01:09:50,935
Yeah, I see her.

1247
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:53,938
We're a go.

1248
01:09:57,007 --> 01:09:58,541
Hi, everybody.

1249
01:09:58,543 --> 01:10:00,076
- Hi.
- How are you?

1250
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:01,678
Hi. Good to see you.

1251
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,879
It's so good to see you.
You look amazing.

1252
01:10:03,881 --> 01:10:06,184
- You too. Cheers.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

1253
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:13,522
No, no, these are real.

1254
01:10:13,524 --> 01:10:15,493
Thank you very much.
So kind of you.

1255
01:10:24,135 --> 01:10:26,104
Okay, counting down.

1256
01:10:26,637 --> 01:10:30,641
Three, two, one.

1257
01:10:31,609 --> 01:10:32,775
Need a gluten-free

1258
01:10:32,777 --> 01:10:33,979
and a broiled fish
for Table Eight.

1259
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:37,647
Where's the vegan
for Table Four?

1260
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:39,485
Over here.

1261
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,225
Go, go, go.

1262
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,641
Oh, God!

1263
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:12,147
Mmm.

1264
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:14,051
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1265
01:11:14,786 --> 01:11:16,521
I'm so hungry.

1266
01:11:17,756 --> 01:11:21,424
Mmm. I haven't eaten anything
in three days.

1267
01:11:21,426 --> 01:11:22,661
I'm sorry.

1268
01:11:23,261 --> 01:11:24,561
Mmm.

1269
01:11:24,563 --> 01:11:26,131
Am I being rude?

1270
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:29,799
She's in deep.

1271
01:11:29,801 --> 01:11:31,570
Maybe half a bowl.

1272
01:11:49,354 --> 01:11:51,187
So,
you're supposed to curtsy.

1273
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:54,290
They actually have a guy there
to teach you how to curtsy.

1274
01:11:54,292 --> 01:11:55,759
Yes, that's true.

1275
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:58,727
Anyway, I go in, I'm doing
this little knee bend.

1276
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:00,597
And the Queen glares at me

1277
01:12:00,599 --> 01:12:02,264
and says,
"That's not a curtsy."

1278
01:12:02,266 --> 01:12:03,232
Really?

1279
01:12:03,234 --> 01:12:05,300
So now,
I am in a curtsy standoff

1280
01:12:05,302 --> 01:12:06,602
with the Queen of England.

1281
01:12:06,604 --> 01:12:08,806
And...

1282
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,241
Are you okay?

1283
01:12:12,243 --> 01:12:14,811
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1284
01:12:14,813 --> 01:12:16,211
Do you need to go
to the bathroom?

1285
01:12:16,213 --> 01:12:17,781
- No! I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

1286
01:12:17,783 --> 01:12:19,382
I'm at this curtsy standoff
with Queen...

1287
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:23,919
- And she's...
- Are you okay?

1288
01:12:23,921 --> 01:12:25,487
I'm fine. Just give me
one second,

1289
01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:27,690
hold on.
I just need to get this...

1290
01:12:27,692 --> 01:12:29,094
You all right?

1291
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:46,011
Game on!

1292
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,025
Excuse me, we need to...

1293
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:11,000
That's good.

1294
01:13:11,002 --> 01:13:13,705
Okay, you're right on
the edge of the blind spot.

1295
01:13:18,342 --> 01:13:20,576
Hey, you all right?

1296
01:13:20,578 --> 01:13:23,245
You good? Oh, you poor thing.

1297
01:13:23,247 --> 01:13:26,648
It's okay. You'll be okay.
Breathe, breathe...

1298
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:29,018
Breathe... Breathe...

1299
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:30,318
Breathe.

1300
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,857
Okay, ten seconds.

1301
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:36,260
Here we go.

1302
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:39,629
Hey, come here.

1303
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:40,862
This can't be here.
You need to

1304
01:13:40,864 --> 01:13:42,130
get this into the kitchen
right away.

1305
01:13:42,132 --> 01:13:44,467
- No problem.
- Okay, go. Go, go.

1306
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:45,668
Coming at you, Deb.

1307
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,439
Okay, here he comes.

1308
01:13:52,609 --> 01:13:53,844
Oh.

1309
01:14:01,152 --> 01:14:02,884
Okay, my mule is out.

1310
01:14:02,886 --> 01:14:05,122
All my ladies
still in the dark.

1311
01:14:08,059 --> 01:14:11,260
- Dude. Dude.
- Yo.

1312
01:14:11,262 --> 01:14:13,230
- You have it?
- Have what?

1313
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:15,598
Oh, I smoked it.

1314
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,831
What do you mean, "smoked it"?

1315
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,067
You know, Josh asked,

1316
01:14:18,069 --> 01:14:19,802
and he was like,
"Hey, do you have..."

1317
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:21,806
Guys, where is he?
What's wrong?

1318
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:23,772
What's happening?

1319
01:14:23,774 --> 01:14:26,541
Stalled in the hallway.
Chitchattin'.

1320
01:14:26,543 --> 01:14:28,113
<i>Tammy, you got to
get him moving now.</i>

1321
01:14:35,185 --> 01:14:37,152
I'm putting the soup down,
I'm like...

1322
01:14:37,154 --> 01:14:39,589
Hey! Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

1323
01:14:39,591 --> 01:14:40,889
You're not getting paid
to talk.

1324
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:42,961
- Let's go, come on.
- Yeah, sorry.

1325
01:14:56,006 --> 01:14:57,942
Here, I'll take those.
I'll take those.

1326
01:15:01,212 --> 01:15:02,380
Thanks.

1327
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:17,962
Bathroom break.
Bathroom break!

1328
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,036
That was intense.

1329
01:16:00,905 --> 01:16:02,439
What?

1330
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,385
I don't know. It could've
fallen off in there.

1331
01:16:17,387 --> 01:16:18,853
It could've fallen off
back there. I'm not sure.

1332
01:16:18,855 --> 01:16:20,421
I was just barfing
my guts out.

1333
01:16:20,423 --> 01:16:23,127
I was back at the table
the whole time.

1334
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:24,960
Seal the exits.

1335
01:16:24,962 --> 01:16:26,228
What? No.
Do we have to make

1336
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,597
such a big deal about this?
Come on.

1337
01:16:27,599 --> 01:16:30,433
- You better lock it up.
- Oh, come on!

1338
01:16:30,435 --> 01:16:32,602
- We need to clear the room.
- You can't do that.

1339
01:16:32,604 --> 01:16:34,437
We need to do a full sweep.

1340
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:35,937
We can't.

1341
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,639
Do you know who's here?

1342
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:39,708
You just lost $150 million.

1343
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:42,611
What would you do if it was
a Rembrandt missing, hmm?

1344
01:16:42,613 --> 01:16:45,214
Dinner will resume shortly,
I promise!

1345
01:16:45,216 --> 01:16:47,016
Thank you so much
for your understanding.

1346
01:16:47,018 --> 01:16:48,920
Just walk towards the stairs.

1347
01:16:51,922 --> 01:16:53,755
Sealin' the exits.

1348
01:16:56,927 --> 01:16:59,027
Gentlemen, we're working
in teams of two.

1349
01:16:59,029 --> 01:17:01,129
We start at the perimeter
and work our way in.

1350
01:17:01,131 --> 01:17:02,430
Once you've been scanned,

1351
01:17:02,432 --> 01:17:04,701
please go directly
to the exit.

1352
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:05,867
There will be someone there

1353
01:17:05,869 --> 01:17:07,005
that will show you
where to go.

1354
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:18,179
Do you know
what's going on here?

1355
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:19,281
An item
seems to have been lost.

1356
01:17:19,283 --> 01:17:20,583
They're looking for it now.

1357
01:17:20,585 --> 01:17:22,587
- Do you know what they lost?
- Diamonds.

1358
01:17:23,154 --> 01:17:24,620
Lots of diamonds.

1359
01:17:24,622 --> 01:17:26,289
Diamonds? Really? We're
waiting around for diamonds?

1360
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,393
Sir, I really just need to go
to the bathroom.

1361
01:17:31,863 --> 01:17:34,062
Okay, shit's blowing up.

1362
01:17:34,064 --> 01:17:36,699
Police coming, Cartier coming.

1363
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:38,369
A bunch of news people coming.

1364
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:40,570
Yeah.

1365
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,671
Yeah, they're doing it.

1366
01:17:42,673 --> 01:17:44,272
They're about halfway through.

1367
01:17:44,274 --> 01:17:46,308
Was there anything you
did or anyone you talked to

1368
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,977
between your table
and the bathroom?

1369
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:49,878
I was rather preoccupied
at the time,

1370
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,483
in case you didn't notice.

1371
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:02,392
Amita, there's a guy
in the kitchen.

1372
01:18:02,394 --> 01:18:04,259
<i>Just give it
a few more minutes.</i>

1373
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:06,297
We don't have a few minutes.

1374
01:18:09,466 --> 01:18:10,501
Oh, shit!

1375
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,103
<i>He's right there.</i>

1376
01:18:15,105 --> 01:18:16,304
<i>Tammy, how close?
Where are you now?</i>

1377
01:18:16,306 --> 01:18:17,509
By the moat.

1378
01:18:19,176 --> 01:18:21,211
Tammy, pull it
out of the water.

1379
01:18:24,314 --> 01:18:26,483
Just plant it in the water!
Just pull it out, right now!

1380
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,021
Found it!

1381
01:18:31,322 --> 01:18:33,254
It was in the water.
It must have fallen off

1382
01:18:33,256 --> 01:18:34,624
while you were running.

1383
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:35,824
May I?

1384
01:18:35,826 --> 01:18:37,291
We got it back.

1385
01:18:37,293 --> 01:18:39,363
Okay. I'll come back down.

1386
01:18:48,104 --> 01:18:50,407
Constance, you good.

1387
01:19:02,753 --> 01:19:04,486
Whoa, sick!

1388
01:19:04,488 --> 01:19:06,557
Uh-uh.
There's glue, there's glue!

1389
01:19:21,706 --> 01:19:23,106
Feeling better?

1390
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:24,442
I do now.

1391
01:19:59,909 --> 01:20:01,479
Couple scotches, please.

1392
01:22:23,887 --> 01:22:25,556
Dear God!

1393
01:22:34,832 --> 01:22:36,701
Thank you. Oh.

1394
01:22:38,368 --> 01:22:39,770
Very nice.

1395
01:22:41,838 --> 01:22:42,838
<i>First of all,</i>

1396
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,438
I'm not a member
of law enforcement.

1397
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,973
I work with
the insurance carrier.

1398
01:22:45,975 --> 01:22:47,809
Which means
I'm either looking for fraud

1399
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:49,577
or I'm looking
for the real necklace.

1400
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:51,612
Beyond that,
I couldn't care less.

1401
01:22:51,614 --> 01:22:54,282
I'm afraid you won't find
either here.

1402
01:22:54,284 --> 01:22:56,720
We'll see about that,
Monsieur...

1403
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:00,524
- Monsieur?
- Delarue-Broussard.

1404
01:23:01,024 --> 01:23:02,156
Okay.

1405
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:03,625
Lawrence,
when did you last see

1406
01:23:03,627 --> 01:23:06,160
what you believe
to be the authentic item?

1407
01:23:06,162 --> 01:23:07,830
When it left here
for the Met Gala.

1408
01:23:07,832 --> 01:23:09,565
When did you know
this was a fake?

1409
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:11,267
The moment it was returned.

1410
01:23:11,269 --> 01:23:12,800
And you two.

1411
01:23:12,802 --> 01:23:14,303
You had your eyes
on the necklace

1412
01:23:14,305 --> 01:23:15,771
the entire evening?

1413
01:23:15,773 --> 01:23:17,440
Apart from when
Miss Kluger had her

1414
01:23:17,442 --> 01:23:19,107
unfortunate incident
in the public toilet.

1415
01:23:19,109 --> 01:23:20,275
That's correct.

1416
01:23:20,277 --> 01:23:22,177
Did you accompany her inside?

1417
01:23:22,179 --> 01:23:23,544
It's a women's bathroom.

1418
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:24,847
It's a very big necklace.

1419
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:26,581
There is only one entrance
in and out.

1420
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:28,985
We were stationed at the door.

1421
01:23:28,987 --> 01:23:30,919
Did you check the plumbing?

1422
01:23:30,921 --> 01:23:32,888
- No.
- I did.

1423
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,359
Okay, keep going forward.

1424
01:23:38,395 --> 01:23:41,498
Squeaky clean, so to speak.

1425
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:46,537
Whoever stole this necklace

1426
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:51,572
managed to get out
without being detected.

1427
01:23:51,574 --> 01:23:54,041
Which means we're looking
for someone very smart.

1428
01:23:54,043 --> 01:23:55,509
Gentlemen.

1429
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:57,345
I've seen
a thoroughbred racehorse

1430
01:23:57,347 --> 01:23:59,548
thrown into a tree shredder.

1431
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:00,982
People will go
to great lengths

1432
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:03,287
to defraud
an insurance carrier.

1433
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:07,688
There! What's this?

1434
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:09,558
I'm saying
that's not a blind spot.

1435
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,361
- What do you call that then?
- The bathroom.

1436
01:24:12,363 --> 01:24:13,696
I don't see a bathroom.

1437
01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:14,662
That's...

1438
01:24:14,664 --> 01:24:16,164
Because it's
in the blind spot.

1439
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:18,633
What can someone steal
from a bathroom anyway?

1440
01:24:18,635 --> 01:24:20,635
I don't know, toiletries,

1441
01:24:20,637 --> 01:24:22,638
mints, hand towels,

1442
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,941
a six-pound diamond necklace,
apparently.

1443
01:24:25,943 --> 01:24:27,043
Now, who's this?

1444
01:24:27,045 --> 01:24:28,177
A busboy?

1445
01:24:28,179 --> 01:24:29,311
Do you know him?

1446
01:24:29,313 --> 01:24:30,681
How would I know a busboy?

1447
01:24:31,448 --> 01:24:33,147
Aren't we posh?

1448
01:24:33,149 --> 01:24:35,750
I don't know everyone who goes
in and out of the museum.

1449
01:24:35,752 --> 01:24:37,385
Why do you care
about a busboy?

1450
01:24:37,387 --> 01:24:39,353
He's the only person who moves
in and out of the blind spot

1451
01:24:39,355 --> 01:24:40,723
during the period in question.

1452
01:24:40,725 --> 01:24:42,794
Could you please
stop calling it a blind spot?

1453
01:24:43,761 --> 01:24:44,692
Fine.

1454
01:24:44,694 --> 01:24:47,795
The bathroom door
that we can't see

1455
01:24:47,797 --> 01:24:50,264
because of your unique
camera placement.

1456
01:24:50,266 --> 01:24:54,068
This is the most sophisticated
museum security in the world.

1457
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:56,571
Every piece of art is recorded
from multiple angles.

1458
01:24:56,573 --> 01:25:00,241
We just don't happen to
keep art in the bathroom.

1459
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:02,376
I'm not a critic, Kyle.

1460
01:25:02,378 --> 01:25:04,545
I'm an insurance investigator.

1461
01:25:04,547 --> 01:25:05,947
I didn't wanna do it.

1462
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:07,883
But Eric's all, like,
"Come on!"

1463
01:25:07,885 --> 01:25:09,951
I'm, like, "Dude, I don't
do that anymore."

1464
01:25:09,953 --> 01:25:12,487
He's, like, "Everyone's out
on the loading dock!"

1465
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:14,555
I know it was really stupid.

1466
01:25:14,557 --> 01:25:17,192
I know I'm an asshole,

1467
01:25:17,194 --> 01:25:18,662
but it wasn't even my weed.

1468
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:22,031
I'm sorry, what?

1469
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:23,665
It wasn't my weed!
Do you want me

1470
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:25,334
to pee in a cup or something?

1471
01:25:25,336 --> 01:25:26,668
No, that won't be necessary.

1472
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:27,936
Are you sure?
I really don't mind.

1473
01:25:27,938 --> 01:25:28,803
I'm positive.

1474
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:30,539
They put the necklace on me.

1475
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:32,574
Then I walked the red carpet.

1476
01:25:32,576 --> 01:25:34,276
Then I saw the exhibit.

1477
01:25:34,278 --> 01:25:36,210
Then I ate my soup.

1478
01:25:36,212 --> 01:25:37,580
Then I hurled my guts out.

1479
01:25:37,582 --> 01:25:38,813
Then the necklace was gone.

1480
01:25:38,815 --> 01:25:40,615
And then
everybody freaked out.

1481
01:25:40,617 --> 01:25:43,718
And then they found it again,
I thought.

1482
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,519
But, no?

1483
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:47,455
This gentleman.

1484
01:25:47,457 --> 01:25:50,025
- Claude Becker.
- Mmm-hmm.

1485
01:25:50,027 --> 01:25:52,527
He was my date.

1486
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:54,796
Was there ever a time
you two were alone

1487
01:25:54,798 --> 01:25:56,768
while you were wearing
the necklace?

1488
01:26:02,338 --> 01:26:04,540
No.

1489
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:06,511
Anyone present with you
in the bathroom?

1490
01:26:07,377 --> 01:26:09,911
My head was in a toilet bowl.

1491
01:26:09,913 --> 01:26:11,179
How 'bout after?

1492
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:13,182
A lot of people.

1493
01:26:13,184 --> 01:26:14,786
Do you know this woman?

1494
01:26:17,787 --> 01:26:18,754
No.

1495
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,187
Debbie Ocean,
convicted felon.

1496
01:26:20,189 --> 01:26:21,555
Her brother, Danny Ocean,

1497
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:22,958
more convicted felon.

1498
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,693
She was present on
the night of the incident.

1499
01:26:25,695 --> 01:26:27,195
Did she steal the necklace?

1500
01:26:27,197 --> 01:26:29,598
Apparently not, she's
the only one with an alibi.

1501
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,099
Smiling at the camera
the entire time.

1502
01:26:32,101 --> 01:26:34,068
Ooh. So...

1503
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:37,540
So I have five innocent people
who seem to be suspects,

1504
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:40,044
and someone who should be
a suspect but isn't.

1505
01:26:40,711 --> 01:26:42,510
I have cameras

1506
01:26:42,512 --> 01:26:44,780
covering every inch
of the museum,

1507
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:46,882
except for the loo,

1508
01:26:46,884 --> 01:26:51,986
where $150 million was stolen
from that neck, your neck.

1509
01:26:51,988 --> 01:26:54,488
- Interesting case.
- Mmm.

1510
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:56,157
Some days, I love my job.

1511
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:59,061
I love my job, too.

1512
01:27:24,253 --> 01:27:25,989
You guys are fucked.

1513
01:27:27,024 --> 01:27:28,757
Nice place.

1514
01:27:28,759 --> 01:27:29,958
It must be a bitch to heat.

1515
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,759
Excuse me!
You are trespassing.

1516
01:27:31,761 --> 01:27:33,861
No. We asked her to come.

1517
01:27:33,863 --> 01:27:35,532
You asked her to come?

1518
01:27:36,867 --> 01:27:38,098
Oh.

1519
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,035
We realized a few days ago
that Miss Kluger...

1520
01:27:40,037 --> 01:27:41,969
Was not
a total fricking idiot.

1521
01:27:41,971 --> 01:27:44,942
Might have gotten a sense
of what we were doing.

1522
01:27:49,947 --> 01:27:52,446
You've got one of the greatest
necks in the world.

1523
01:27:52,448 --> 01:27:53,781
<i>First of all,
if there's one thing I know,</i>

1524
01:27:53,783 --> 01:27:55,517
<i>it's bad acting.</i>

1525
01:27:55,519 --> 01:27:57,184
In fact,
you've got the only neck

1526
01:27:57,186 --> 01:27:58,956
that could carry
this necklace off.

1527
01:28:00,123 --> 01:28:01,757
<i>I almost
never throw up.</i>

1528
01:28:01,759 --> 01:28:04,326
Even when I'm really wasted.

1529
01:28:04,328 --> 01:28:05,794
It was in the water.

1530
01:28:05,796 --> 01:28:06,998
It must have fallen off
while you were running.

1531
01:28:09,733 --> 01:28:12,467
<i>And last but not least,</i>

1532
01:28:12,469 --> 01:28:14,268
<i>I never forget a face.</i>

1533
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:15,639
<i>Debbie Ocean.</i>

1534
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:20,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1535
01:28:20,042 --> 01:28:22,943
So, seems to me,
eight shares of 150 million

1536
01:28:22,945 --> 01:28:26,016
is better than seven shares
of nothing, right?

1537
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:28,650
Chilly!

1538
01:28:28,652 --> 01:28:30,152
Hi, Daph! Welcome to the team!

1539
01:28:30,154 --> 01:28:31,687
Let's not all high-five
at once.

1540
01:28:31,689 --> 01:28:34,121
Plus, I am the one
who is saving your asses

1541
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:35,857
- from insurance fraud.
- What?

1542
01:28:35,859 --> 01:28:37,927
- Insurance fraud?
- I was gonna get to that.

1543
01:28:37,929 --> 01:28:39,361
When?

1544
01:28:39,363 --> 01:28:41,295
It seems that they've assigned
an insurance investigator...

1545
01:28:41,297 --> 01:28:43,598
Who's about to look up
your ass with a flashlight.

1546
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,633
- Who?
- This little <i>Columbo</i> dude,

1547
01:28:45,635 --> 01:28:46,735
everything
but the trench coat.

1548
01:28:46,737 --> 01:28:47,835
Totally on to you.

1549
01:28:47,837 --> 01:28:49,772
His name is John Frazier.

1550
01:28:49,774 --> 01:28:51,139
- You know him?
- Yes.

1551
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:52,808
He busted my father twice
and my brother once.

1552
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:53,942
He's family.

1553
01:28:53,944 --> 01:28:55,442
All right.
Lest we forget,

1554
01:28:55,444 --> 01:28:57,946
this entire enterprise
was to keep me out of jail.

1555
01:28:57,948 --> 01:28:59,347
Hey. No one's going to jail.

1556
01:28:59,349 --> 01:29:01,348
- Are you sure?
- We expected this.

1557
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:02,584
We prepared for this.

1558
01:29:02,586 --> 01:29:04,553
Yup, that's clear.

1559
01:29:04,555 --> 01:29:07,455
We will not be
the prime suspect.

1560
01:29:07,457 --> 01:29:09,357
Okay, well then
who will be the prime suspect?

1561
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:11,660
There's a few.
We've got the security guys,

1562
01:29:11,662 --> 01:29:12,960
we've got the busboys...

1563
01:29:12,962 --> 01:29:14,965
The shady guy
who put you away.

1564
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:18,799
Wow!

1565
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:21,303
The boyfriend.

1566
01:29:21,305 --> 01:29:24,205
<i>Yup. They were gonna
be looking for somebody.</i>

1567
01:29:24,207 --> 01:29:26,844
Just had to make sure
it wasn't one of us.

1568
01:29:27,778 --> 01:29:29,244
It's nice.

1569
01:29:29,246 --> 01:29:31,044
Thanks.

1570
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:33,382
That is amazing!
The precision...

1571
01:29:33,384 --> 01:29:34,650
Right?

1572
01:29:34,652 --> 01:29:35,616
It's always
the attention to detail

1573
01:29:35,618 --> 01:29:36,884
and the little grace notes

1574
01:29:36,886 --> 01:29:39,724
that really make
something sing.

1575
01:29:40,858 --> 01:29:42,693
Why are you doing this?

1576
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,295
Uh...

1577
01:29:46,396 --> 01:29:49,630
I don't have that many close
female friendships.

1578
01:29:49,632 --> 01:29:51,232
And book clubs are the worst.

1579
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:53,367
So I just thought

1580
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:55,036
this could be
something fun to share.

1581
01:29:55,038 --> 01:29:57,007
You're becoming a criminal
because you're lonely?

1582
01:29:58,376 --> 01:30:00,741
Who isn't sometimes, right?

1583
01:30:00,743 --> 01:30:02,179
Are you an only child?

1584
01:30:04,014 --> 01:30:06,580
<i>Midsummer Night's
Dream</i> in Miami?

1585
01:30:06,582 --> 01:30:08,349
It's Shakespeare.

1586
01:30:08,351 --> 01:30:11,419
She did summer stock
at Williamstown,

1587
01:30:11,421 --> 01:30:12,787
plus a bunch of off-Broadway.

1588
01:30:12,789 --> 01:30:14,089
What about this one?
She looks good.

1589
01:30:14,091 --> 01:30:16,089
Let's see. Regional theater,

1590
01:30:16,091 --> 01:30:17,858
<i>but she trained at Juilliard.</i>

1591
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:18,960
It's really
a magnificent piece.

1592
01:30:18,962 --> 01:30:20,027
This was your mother's?

1593
01:30:20,029 --> 01:30:22,598
Left to me after her passing.

1594
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,134
A Swedish prince
gave it to her

1595
01:30:25,136 --> 01:30:28,369
in exchange
for her deflowering.

1596
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:29,937
Are they worth something?

1597
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:32,005
Yes, they're worth
quite a lot.

1598
01:30:32,007 --> 01:30:35,376
"Take these,"
my mother said. "Now, go."

1599
01:30:35,378 --> 01:30:36,713
It was moonlight,

1600
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,147
and then he said,

1601
01:30:39,149 --> 01:30:42,420
"I'd give you every star
in that sky."

1602
01:30:43,353 --> 01:30:45,519
I'm sorry.

1603
01:30:45,521 --> 01:30:47,323
It must be difficult for you.

1604
01:30:51,161 --> 01:30:52,826
- Claude Becker?
- Yeah.

1605
01:30:52,828 --> 01:30:53,995
- John Frazier.
- Hi.

1606
01:30:53,997 --> 01:30:56,232
SPD Insurance. How are you?

1607
01:30:57,201 --> 01:30:59,136
So, Claude...

1608
01:31:00,003 --> 01:31:02,206
Like Jean-Claude Van Damme.

1609
01:31:02,773 --> 01:31:03,938
Isn't it?

1610
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,106
What do you want?

1611
01:31:05,108 --> 01:31:08,476
Here are some photographs
of you

1612
01:31:08,478 --> 01:31:09,910
with Miss Kluger.

1613
01:31:09,912 --> 01:31:11,379
Now, as you can see,
there are many photographs

1614
01:31:11,381 --> 01:31:14,049
where your hand
is on the back of her neck.

1615
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:16,483
I don't really remember
where my hands were.

1616
01:31:16,485 --> 01:31:18,853
Ah. To be you.

1617
01:31:18,855 --> 01:31:20,056
Right?

1618
01:31:21,492 --> 01:31:22,857
Problem is,

1619
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:24,192
the necklace has been stolen

1620
01:31:24,194 --> 01:31:26,061
and a fake has been put
in its place.

1621
01:31:26,063 --> 01:31:27,195
Right now, you're the person

1622
01:31:27,197 --> 01:31:28,464
with the greatest
opportunity...

1623
01:31:28,466 --> 01:31:30,699
Why would I wanna steal
a necklace?

1624
01:31:30,701 --> 01:31:32,737
That's what
I keep asking myself.

1625
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:35,271
Why would this guy,

1626
01:31:37,506 --> 01:31:39,109
who's got everything,

1627
01:31:40,377 --> 01:31:41,779
two of these...

1628
01:31:43,313 --> 01:31:45,916
Why would that guy wanna
steal a necklace?

1629
01:31:47,817 --> 01:31:49,353
What was your answer?

1630
01:31:50,953 --> 01:31:52,889
Maybe he doesn't have
everything.

1631
01:31:53,657 --> 01:31:54,857
I think we're done here.

1632
01:31:54,859 --> 01:31:56,223
- Just a theory.
- Really.

1633
01:31:56,225 --> 01:31:57,558
- A shot in the dark.
- We're done.

1634
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,992
I'm probably wrong.

1635
01:31:58,994 --> 01:32:01,929
It's a beautiful piece,
and I want you to have it.

1636
01:32:01,931 --> 01:32:04,335
I can't go any lower.
Just hold on one second.

1637
01:32:06,636 --> 01:32:07,837
Hello?

1638
01:32:08,838 --> 01:32:10,138
Oh, hey.

1639
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,639
Hi.

1640
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:13,107
What're you doing right now?

1641
01:32:20,617 --> 01:32:21,849
Hello, John.

1642
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:23,151
Hello, Debbie.

1643
01:32:23,153 --> 01:32:24,986
You look well,
how long's it been?

1644
01:32:24,988 --> 01:32:27,988
A few years.
Minus good behavior.

1645
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:29,557
- Right.
- Yeah.

1646
01:32:29,559 --> 01:32:31,860
Thank you for calling.
I was gonna call you.

1647
01:32:31,862 --> 01:32:33,896
- Yeah, I didn't do it.
- Of course not.

1648
01:32:33,898 --> 01:32:35,429
You were just on camera
20 feet away

1649
01:32:35,431 --> 01:32:36,764
while the jewels
were being nicked.

1650
01:32:36,766 --> 01:32:38,031
It's a coincidence.

1651
01:32:38,033 --> 01:32:39,933
No. That's a solid alibi.

1652
01:32:39,935 --> 01:32:41,302
What is it? Is it genetic?

1653
01:32:41,304 --> 01:32:43,004
Are the whole family
like this?

1654
01:32:43,006 --> 01:32:44,205
Except for my aunt Ida.

1655
01:32:44,207 --> 01:32:46,340
- Librarian?
- Mmm. Homemaker.

1656
01:32:46,342 --> 01:32:47,776
Right, I'm gonna
make this easy for you.

1657
01:32:47,778 --> 01:32:49,445
I don't want you.

1658
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,280
I just want the necklace.

1659
01:32:52,282 --> 01:32:54,014
I don't care.
I'll say I found it in a cab.

1660
01:32:54,016 --> 01:32:55,552
How about some of it?

1661
01:32:57,755 --> 01:33:01,089
- How much?
- Hypothetically, 10%.

1662
01:33:01,091 --> 01:33:02,723
And where's
the hypothetical rest?

1663
01:33:02,725 --> 01:33:05,593
Oh, I don't know. Literally.

1664
01:33:05,595 --> 01:33:08,428
Oh, God. This is exhausting!

1665
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:12,334
I mean, when they said
come over, I was like... Ugh.

1666
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,402
You know, with the jet lag,
the time difference,

1667
01:33:14,404 --> 01:33:16,303
Arsenal in the Cup Final
this weekend.

1668
01:33:16,305 --> 01:33:18,607
But now I'm here.
It's bloody interesting.

1669
01:33:18,609 --> 01:33:19,610
Yeah?

1670
01:33:25,081 --> 01:33:27,949
So it's not just profit,
it's revenge.

1671
01:33:27,951 --> 01:33:30,384
It's a twofer.

1672
01:33:30,386 --> 01:33:32,887
He frames you, you frame him,
scores are settled.

1673
01:33:32,889 --> 01:33:34,222
I'm just the courier.

1674
01:33:34,224 --> 01:33:37,224
All is right with the world,
it's brilliant.

1675
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:38,759
Just trying to help out
an old friend.

1676
01:33:38,761 --> 01:33:42,062
You know, one day, you are
gonna have to let this go?

1677
01:33:42,064 --> 01:33:44,100
And one day, I will.

1678
01:33:45,368 --> 01:33:49,271
Let's just say,
for argument's sake,

1679
01:33:49,273 --> 01:33:51,876
that I do know where there's
a part of that necklace.

1680
01:33:52,975 --> 01:33:54,577
Can you get a search warrant?

1681
01:33:55,979 --> 01:33:59,280
I'd need
probable cause.

1682
01:33:59,282 --> 01:34:03,518
Well, we may or may not be
working on that right now.

1683
01:34:07,556 --> 01:34:09,326
Do you wanna play a game?

1684
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:12,429
What kind of game?

1685
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:15,966
A card game.

1686
01:34:18,734 --> 01:34:20,403
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh?

1687
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:24,474
- Uh-huh?
- Yes, yes!

1688
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,549
I'll be right back.

1689
01:34:34,551 --> 01:34:36,520
Where are you going?

1690
01:34:37,587 --> 01:34:38,589
Wait.

1691
01:34:58,173 --> 01:35:00,208
Where are you?

1692
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:02,445
I'll be right there.

1693
01:36:09,078 --> 01:36:12,879
You have no idea how this
came to be in your possession?

1694
01:36:12,881 --> 01:36:14,283
No.

1695
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:17,351
But you were Ms. Kluger's date

1696
01:36:17,353 --> 01:36:19,821
the night
these necklaces were switched.

1697
01:36:19,823 --> 01:36:21,358
Yes, I was.

1698
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:26,663
Does that strike you
as a rather large coincidence?

1699
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:34,035
Including a 33.18, D color,
internally flawless diamond...

1700
01:36:34,037 --> 01:36:35,969
<i>Are you familiar
with a company called</i>

1701
01:36:35,971 --> 01:36:38,138
<i>Becker Holdings, LLC?</i>

1702
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,508
<i>Of course.</i>

1703
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:42,576
<i>Well, it seems
four sweet old ladies,</i>

1704
01:36:42,578 --> 01:36:45,347
<i>who apparently don't exist,</i>

1705
01:36:45,349 --> 01:36:48,849
<i>have recently transferred some
very large sums of money</i>

1706
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:51,721
<i>into Becker Holdings, LLC.</i>

1707
01:36:54,056 --> 01:36:57,126
<i>Do you know how that might
have happened, Mr. Becker?</i>

1708
01:37:02,599 --> 01:37:04,965
I think
I need to talk to my lawyer.

1709
01:37:04,967 --> 01:37:07,703
I think you do.

1710
01:37:15,311 --> 01:37:17,344
- To our dear friend Carl...
- Claude.

1711
01:37:17,346 --> 01:37:22,116
Claude Becker. May he rest
in peace in prison.

1712
01:37:22,118 --> 01:37:23,384
Cheers.

1713
01:37:23,386 --> 01:37:24,818
Love you,
love you, love you.

1714
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:25,855
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1715
01:37:26,989 --> 01:37:28,190
I have a question.

1716
01:37:28,192 --> 01:37:29,691
So...

1717
01:37:29,693 --> 01:37:31,459
It's good
that he went to jail,

1718
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:33,527
'cause it's great
that we didn't.

1719
01:37:33,529 --> 01:37:38,299
But if you only sold
the jewels for 85 million,

1720
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:40,470
how does it work out
that we get 16 apiece?

1721
01:37:43,105 --> 01:37:44,472
Do you wanna?

1722
01:37:44,474 --> 01:37:46,974
You thought we were just
gonna steal one necklace?

1723
01:37:46,976 --> 01:37:50,577
What do you think we are,
a bunch of pussies?

1724
01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:52,046
<i>See, while everyone
was worried</i>

1725
01:37:52,048 --> 01:37:53,580
<i>about what was happening
around your neck...</i>

1726
01:37:53,582 --> 01:37:55,583
<i>And you were
hurling your guts out...</i>

1727
01:37:55,585 --> 01:37:56,787
<i>Thanks for that, by the way.</i>

1728
01:37:57,686 --> 01:37:58,818
It was amazing.

1729
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:00,187
That was really impressive.

1730
01:38:00,189 --> 01:38:01,488
That was really nice,
actually.

1731
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:04,625
The place
kinda went on lockdown.

1732
01:38:04,627 --> 01:38:06,093
<i>The kitchen
was cleared out, too.</i>

1733
01:38:06,095 --> 01:38:08,862
<i>And while everyone
was watching the entrance,</i>

1734
01:38:08,864 --> 01:38:10,867
<i>we thought we'd check out
the exhibit.</i>

1735
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:16,206
Because why would you
just steal one necklace,

1736
01:38:18,307 --> 01:38:21,575
when you could steal more?

1737
01:38:21,577 --> 01:38:24,277
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

1738
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:25,746
That's a lot.

1739
01:38:25,748 --> 01:38:27,048
Yeah.

1740
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:29,918
We didn't just print
the Toussaint from that thing.

1741
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,518
<i>We printed a lot of jewels.</i>

1742
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,455
<i>Felt like I was
working at Kinko's.</i>

1743
01:38:34,457 --> 01:38:36,590
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

1744
01:38:36,592 --> 01:38:38,595
<i>I decided to visit
an old friend.</i>

1745
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:50,638
<i>Amazon sells
these 20-foot selfie sticks.</i>

1746
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,643
<i>All they saw
was a quick, little blur.</i>

1747
01:38:57,212 --> 01:38:58,780
<i>It was a temporary
exhibit and they built</i>

1748
01:38:58,782 --> 01:38:59,783
<i>this metal grid
to hang the dresses from.</i>

1749
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:05,588
<i>We just decided to suspend Yen
from that as well.</i>

1750
01:39:24,439 --> 01:39:26,307
What if somebody came in?

1751
01:39:26,309 --> 01:39:27,842
Oh. Somebody did.

1752
01:39:27,844 --> 01:39:29,311
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't
be here. We're clearing

1753
01:39:29,313 --> 01:39:31,782
this whole area.

1754
01:40:10,753 --> 01:40:12,855
Ma'am.

1755
01:40:14,756 --> 01:40:15,759
Calm down.

1756
01:40:30,506 --> 01:40:32,376
We're okay.

1757
01:41:07,676 --> 01:41:10,111
<i>Stealing the necklace
was great,</i>

1758
01:41:10,113 --> 01:41:11,445
but without that diversion,

1759
01:41:11,447 --> 01:41:12,879
without clearing out
the exhibit...

1760
01:41:12,881 --> 01:41:15,148
We wouldn't have been
able to grab these.

1761
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:16,451
These,

1762
01:41:16,453 --> 01:41:21,722
which bring your cuts to
$38,300,000 each.

1763
01:41:21,724 --> 01:41:23,190
- Huh?
- Yeah.

1764
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:41,610
Yeah.

1765
01:41:43,779 --> 01:41:46,483
Yeah, I know.
It's so beautiful.

1766
01:41:58,728 --> 01:42:01,094
Sweetie, I know,
but you can't put gum

1767
01:42:01,096 --> 01:42:02,996
in your sister's hair.

1768
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:05,836
I don't care if she tried
to put it in your nose first.

1769
01:42:19,682 --> 01:42:21,615
What's up, YouTube?
It's your girl!

1770
01:42:21,617 --> 01:42:22,750
Check out my new crib.

1771
01:42:22,752 --> 01:42:24,788
I'm on the co-op board.

1772
01:42:29,525 --> 01:42:32,125
- Cut!
- That's a cut!

1773
01:42:32,127 --> 01:42:33,630
- Cut, cut, cut!
- That's a cut!

1774
01:42:34,462 --> 01:42:35,964
Resetting back to one.

1775
01:42:35,966 --> 01:42:37,897
Uh, just, you know...
Smoother.

1776
01:42:37,899 --> 01:42:40,501
Just a little bit of space,
please. It was perfect.

1777
01:42:40,503 --> 01:42:42,102
I just need it faster
and more damaged.

1778
01:42:42,104 --> 01:42:43,737
All right? Great.

1779
01:42:43,739 --> 01:42:45,541
It's not that hard!

1780
01:44:03,418 --> 01:44:04,954
You would've loved it.
