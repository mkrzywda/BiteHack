00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,240
Yes, sir.

<i>When we are finished with you, 
you will no longer be David Webb.</i>

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,260
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,640
You can't say [??].

9
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,180
- [ ?? ]

Eventually you're gonna

12
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,900
you chose right here

74
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,690
How are you going to handle it?

00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,100
We cut the head off this thing.

76
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,630
Sir. I'd like to be point
on this operation.

77

- You're not indoctrinated for this material. 
- I'm already into it.

I embedded malware into Parsons' download.  
When those files are opened, I can trace them.

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,070
I'd be in.

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,120
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,

81

And if he's out there,
I'll give you Bourne, too.

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,090
but,

- Do not push your personal agenda, to the DEI again. 
- Understood.

85
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,160
Alright, I think you can help me.

86
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,670
I'm going to give you full 
operational control on this.

87
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,680
And I'll assure that you have 
acces to any relevant teams

88
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,600
and resources. And I want to 
know every move you make.

Parsons boarded a bus half-hour ago.

99
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,160
west across Athens. 
I got two local teams en route.

100
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,400
- Any sign of Bourne? 
- Not so far.

101
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,270
He's involved in this somehow, 
I can feel it.

Where are we?

106
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Carson's assett has just
arrived at Syntayma Square.

107
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,920
There's a demonstration in front 
of the Natalia[??] building.

108
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,690
I think she will use it as cover.

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,170
Before [ ???] at the square,

110
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,370
We come in for Parsons, pair up at Parliament, 
and any possible run-in with Bourne.

111
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,390
Copy that, sir. 
Sir, the asset has landed.

112
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,380
- Alpha Team arriving now. 
- Copy that.

113
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,740
- I have the Alpha Team feed. 
- Pull them up.

114
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,400
Athens police is reporting tactical
teams moving on the demonstrators.

115
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,050
- Isolate all social media posts from the Square.
- Yes, ma'am.

116
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,840
- Rewind Alpha One's feed.
- Yes, ma'am. Twenty seconds.

117
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,750
- What's wrong? 
- I hacked the Agency.

118
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,640
- 19:11.75 [???].

119
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,870
I hacked all the black ops files, 
including the Armani. [ ???]

120
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,420
Who you doing this for?

121
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,640
Stop.

122

123
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,120
Enhance.

124
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,110
Find her.

125
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,140
- I told you, Dassault is going to get you killed. 
- We don't have a choice, Jason.

126
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,350
They started again, a new program, 
Iron Hand. It's even worse than before.

127
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,220
- What's that got to do with me? 
- Because it matters.  It matters.

128
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,520
To me, it doesn't.

129
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,210
All that matters is staying alive. 
You get off the grid, survive.

130
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,250
I don't believe that,
and neither do you.

131
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,150
Look at yourself.

132
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,150
Look at what you're doing.

133
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,700
You can't live like
this for much longer.

134
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,970
Jason, I came here
because I found something.

135
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,530
I found you father's
[???] Treadstone files.

136
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,570
He was an analyst.
He wasn't in operations.

137
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,340
- He wasn't near any of that stuff. 
- I'm telling you what I saw.

138
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,780
It looks like he was involved directly.

139
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,840
- And there's more. More about you. 
- What do you mean?

140
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,660
Before you joined the program, 
they were watching you.

141
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,970
Watching me?

142
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,650
You tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

143
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,250
And you don't know the truth 
about what they did to you.

144
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,120
You need to read those files.

145
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,430
Move

146
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,610
Number One has eyes on two targets.  
One female, one male.

147
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:05,740
- Identify the male. 
- Copy that.

148
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,940
- Identify the male. 
- Copy that.

149
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,870
You gotta get out of here before
they [???] this part of the city.

150
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,320
Head north.

151
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,090
Meet me at the statue of Athena.

152
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,900
- I'll take them away from you. 
- Hey, stop!

153
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,930
That's him.

154
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,310
Now.

155
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,270
[ ???] Bourne. .

156
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,250
- Cleared to engage the target. 
- Copy.

157
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,900
Sir, Alpha Team's comms are down.

158
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,140
We've lost Support Team No. 3 [ ???]

159
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,790
- 22:55.880 [ ??? ].

160
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,900
- 22:58.790 [ ??? ]

161
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,300
Sir, rioting is starting to break out and 
Athens' declaring State of Emergency.

162
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,990
We got her.

163
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,740
Second team put her in a box.

164
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,170
Suspect last reported seen on a police 
motorcycle. He's heading north.

165
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,300
- Where the hell is the asset? 
- Two minutes out, sir.

166
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,760
- Carson is at the statue of Athena. 
- Copy that.

167
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,170
- [???] Team is down. 
- Sir, the asset is arriving on scene.

168
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,840
Philip the gosh down, give 
me direct comm to the Asset.

169
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,050
- 26:57.720 [???].

170
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,400
- I need eyes overhead. 
- Remit the satellite's feed.

171
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,330
They're actually [??].
Twelve satellites available.

172
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,620
- 27:20.320 [ ???]. 
- Yes, sir.

173
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,040
The [??? ] feed is online.

174
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,530
- 27:38.40 [ ???] barrier. 
- The target is [???] will be forced to turn left.

175
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,270
Another barricade at 200 meters. 
Target turning left.

176
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,750
Bourne is heading for the alley. 
Left at top of the hill.

177
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,710
Here, got out. Where is he going?

178
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,620
Found a way out. 200 meters
to your left. 19 Salomon.

179
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,960
Get to the roof.  Bourne 
will pass by your line-of-sight.

180
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
I see soldiers coming.

181
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,150
- 29:12.000 [??? ].

182
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,000
- 29:12.2000 [??? ]. 
- Copy that.

183
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,080
Approaching the targets
at Harmonien and 50th.

184
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,140
- 29:47.040 [ ???].

185
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,240
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

186
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,050
Copy that.

187
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,470
- 30:18.960 [???] .

188
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,600
Targets with you within 15 seconds.

189
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,830
5 seconds.

190
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,800
- Contact. 
Stay low!

191
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,020
One shot.

192
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,650
Hold on.

193
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,950
Where's Bourne?

194
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,240
Police at the top have spotted three bodies 
on the roof that the asset attacked.

195
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,680
Team's on it's way.

196
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,740
Nicky.

197
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,570
Don't move.

198
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,110
The tactical team has entered the building.

199
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,320
- Asset, you need to get out of there. 
- Negative

200
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,450
We don't even know
if Bourne is still alive.

201
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,840
So [???] is gone.

202
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,030
This is Director Dewey, 27 is gone.

203
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,800
Hold on, Nicky.

204
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,980
I'm going to get you to cover.

205
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,600
Don't, no ..

206
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,770
I'm coming..

207
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,550
Location was from this office, sir.

208
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,130
If he was working with Nikky Parsons, 
he will have suggested Bourne.

209
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,150
And let me know if you
get a hit on that malware.

210
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,050
Sir, can I clarify one thing.

211
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,300
- 34:20.040  [??? ]

212
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Plus he has to think Bourne.

213
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,170
- 34:22.280 [ ???]

214
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,410
His behavior or will-power?

215
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,970
And suggests a connectioin.

216
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,260
The last time Bourne came back he 
exposed the Black Briar program.

217
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,780
He compromised accurate operations.

218
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,620
And the assets in Syria, under cover.

219
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,110
He was captured, and tortured. And
took near a damn year to get him out.

220
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,060
So you think that's why Bourne 
wanted the files. To go public again?

221
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,910
I have no idea why he came back.

222
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,030
But whatever he's doing, 
he wants to destroy us.

223
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,860
I can't let that happen.

224
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,320
So please give me a call, 
soon as you hear anything.

225
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,800
Yes, sir.

226
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:58,490
<font color="#ff8080">- Treadstone  >>>  IronHand</font>
<font color="#ff8080">- Richard Webb Involved. JB Under surveillance.</font>

227
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,210
And now the founder and chairman 
of DEEP DREAM .. Aaron Kalloor.

228
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,840
Ahh, you know why you're here. 
We will be unveiling a new platform.

229
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,040
We think it is a bold new step, to
allow us to serve our community better.

230
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,880
We're turning in right now to 
trascend national boundaries, and

231
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,650
I think we're at 1.5 Billion users.

232
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,080
You know we have an ecosystem of hundreds 
of thousands of apps at this point.

233
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,970
And what this new platform
will do is integrate

234
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,220
User's data and preferences,

235
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,110
And use that information, 
to enrich and tailor-make

236
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,350
Each unique user experience, 
in a way that is frankly

237
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,720
Unprecedented.

238
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,330
Now, I can see some journalists' brains 
twitching, ready to ask about privacy.

239
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,420
This is a concern of many
people, and so it should be.

240
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,870
This is something that matters 
to us, and let me just say

241
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,120
I understand, nobody wants to feel 
like they're being watched

242
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,860
So let just tell you, when you come to 
DEEP DREAM, when you use our service.

243
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,150
No-one will be watching you.

244
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,810
- Enjoy your meal? 
- Thank you.

245
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,340
Congratulations,

246
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,040
I hear you stock-holders were very 
happy with the new platform.

247
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,110
And I heard you got hacked.

248
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,310
You were [ ???].

249
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,800
This changes everything. 
There's too much risk.

250
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,770
- I'm out. 
- Hey,

251
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,460
You are an extra-ordinarily gifted 
and perceptive young man.

252
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,600
And you agreed to help us it's because 
you understood the very grave threats,

253
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,690
Do you have idea the shit-storm on our 
hands if this arrangement goes public?

254
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,960
I agreed to it, and you were more ..

255
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,530
Our enemies have become 
much more sophisticated.

256
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,090
Gathering meta-data is
no longer adequate.

257
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,950
We need a back-door into
your new platform, in a way

258
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,770
- 40:28.680 [ ???]. 
- When that's not enough, you want something new.

259
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,920
You .. you don't get it, do you?

260
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,830
Privacy is,, is, freedom.

261
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,760
I believe that's something you 
should think about defending.

262
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,560
You little prick, you didn't believe 
in privacy or freedom when

263
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,680
When you started. 
I've turned you into a billionaire.

264
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,470
I have paid you back many,
many, many times over.

265
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,370
And I was not comfortable
with any of this.  I'm out.

266
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,730
- I'm done selling out our customers. 
- Yet you would sell out your country.

267
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,050
The truth is, we would't be having 
this conversation if you didn't feel

268
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
Personally at risk.

269
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,430
You talk about a free internet, you tell 
yourself you're saving the world,

270
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,480
All you're doing is making it a much more 
dangerous place. And you sure as hell

271
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,600
Making this country much
more difficult to defend.

272
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,650
And you're sure as
hell accountable for that.

273
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,370
<font color="#808080">BERLIN, GERMANY</font>

274
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,550
Oi, everything on the table.

275
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,580
Open it.

276
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,280
Sure.

277
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,920
Bourne's surfaced.

278
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,480
- In Berlin.

279
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,260
Get the Berlin team out.

280
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,680
- Where is she? 
- She is dead.

281
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,800
She knew the risks. I owed her.

282
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,000
She made her choice.

283
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,080
You exploited her.

284
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,780
- Blue Team is mobile. 
- Who do we have in the location?

285
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,950
- We can try to find Christian Dassault . 
- Can we put a bit more?

286
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,650
Not on the app. I'm activating CC TV now.

287
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,370
So I've been thinking,

288
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,400
What if we go this wrong?

289
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,030
What if they still come for us?

290
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,700
What if it's something else?

291
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,760
You don't have any idea
of who you're dealing with.

292
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,020
We should work together more.

293
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,990
We both have the same thing right.

294
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,200
You expose the [???].

295
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,170
We both want to take down
the [??] that control society.

296
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,670
I'm not on your side.

297
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,700
CC TV is online.

298
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,600
- He's on a computer. 
- Yes,

299
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,060
He puts those files online,

300
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,540
Operations will be compromised, 
 and people will die.

301
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,720
Yes, sir.

302
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,300
Is this what you've
done for your files?

303
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,730
These programs have
to be exposed. [???]

304
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,960
Be glad I know you well.

<font color="#ff8080">TREADSTONE PROGRAM</font>
<font color="#ff8080">A proposal by Richard Web</font>

306
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,830
We need that computer.

307
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,350
- Hasn't found the malware.

308
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,110
I can use it to delete the files.

309
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,200
<font color="#ff8080">REMOTE STATUS -  ACCESS CONFIRMED</font> 
<font color="#ff8080">LINK COMPLETE.</font>

310
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,690
- Where's that team? 
- Five minutes out, sir.

311
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,720
Listen to me Dave, I've done something.

312
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,790
Something,

313
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,450
It came with a cost.

314
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,520
One day, you'll understand why.

315
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,940
I got to get back to Washington.

316
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,100
I love you, son.

317
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,230
They're fighting, sir.

318
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,960
One more firewall.

319
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,630
Files deleted, sir.

320
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,940
Call it.

321
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,880
Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.

322
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,130
I'm not in charge here.

323
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,460
I wasn't here when you were missing.

324
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,610
I can see you're going through
the old Treadstone files.

325
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,780
Are you tracing you history?

326
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,960
I know you're looking for something.

327
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,850
Let me know if you find it.

328
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,780
Give me that phone.

329
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,760
Yes, sir.

330
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,200
Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me?

331
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,990
- Jason, your Dad was a patriot.

332
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,640
He could see the threats
facing Americans in [???].

333
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,490
Chose to serve his country across

334
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,750
Balance it, Eddie.

335
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,900
Giving up

336
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,960
But to see you on the Agency.

337
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,560
- 52:34 [???].

338
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,810
I'm here to stop it now.

339
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,150
<font color="#ff8080">TEAM ARRIVING.</font> 
<font color="#ff8080">You HAVE 2 MINUTES.</font>

340
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,750
We lost him, sir.

341
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,300
Malcom Smith, contract-only, 
based out of London

342
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,660
Ran all of Tradestone's surveillance in
the late 90's, when Bourne was recruited.

343
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,450
- Is he still active? 
- He's private security now.

344
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:50,200
Contact the asset and tell him who we
want drowned and murderd in 6 hours.

345
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,070
I'd be ... in Stickson.

346
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,030
He'd sick, won't he?

347
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,220
The'res [???] for catching Bourne. 
Instead of killing him.

348
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,390
Alright, let's hear it.

349
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,710
Bourne's been off the
grid for a long time.

350
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,260
He's been hiding in the shadows. 
He's seen things.

351
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,490
He knows things that could help us.

352
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,290
Bring him back in, is the smart move.

353
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,190
And how are we going to do that?

354
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,340
I'll [???] and Bourne with the program.

355
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,040
He concluded Bourne is
still a patriot at heart.

356
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:25,160
Put me back into the program, and [???].

357
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,680
- And where do you suggest that? 
- I'll watch Bourne [???].

358
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,620
Desperately, but our
intests passed, and ...

359
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,930
I can be sort a tech [???].

360
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,190
If I can get face to face with him.

361
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,550
I think I can bring him back in.

362
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,250
One time.  And if it fails ..

363
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,360
You don't have to ..

364
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,270
Well, it makes sense to me. 
What do you think, Bob?

365
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,010
Let's give it a shot.

366
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,970
Alright, do it.

367
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,770
Bring Bourne in,

368
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,110
We'll tie it off.

369
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,640
- This ends now. 
- Thank you, sir.

370
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,040
- Sir, I'm sorry. 
- No, no, don't.

371
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,200
Better get some sleep, kid.

372
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,230
You don't want 24-hours
without looking.

373
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,680
Yes, sir.

374
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,250
It's taking too long, it still shouldn't
be this buggy this close to launch.

375
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,190
Would be so buggy if
James hadn't taken out [???].

376
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,790
- It's the parametes, it's going to have to go. 
- Okay, then we'll have to change it back.

377
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,290
- Pull the car up? 
- Absolutely.

378
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,920
I just don't think we
want the entire piece.

379
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,610
Mr. Kalloor,

380
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,150
Mr. Kalloor, I'm from
the Dept of Justice.

381
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,940
- I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed claim, 
- Really, you have to do this in public?

382
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,950
And the Deep Dream Corporation,
for violation of the Sherman Act.

383
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:25,300
This claim requires you to preserve all 
corporate and personal financial records.

384
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,450
Pending an osmosis to be
filed in Federal Court.

385
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,850
Good day.

386
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,670
- This is Dewey. 
- Aaron, it's a message.

387
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,080
And maybe we should think about what 
we're doing before it gets any worse.

388
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,850
So, you think if we give him 
what he wants, it will end there.

389
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,270
I'm just saying that
maybe we should listen.

390
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,160
I want you to pull up all the records 
of all the meetings Paul had with me.

391
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,980
All the records?

392
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,430
- Even the off-the-books discussions? 
- Especially, those.

393
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,730
I'm going to Vegas,
I need an insurance policy.

394
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:36,330
- Yeah. 
- Are you in London?- Yes.

395
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,810
Who're you sending now?

396
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,250
She serves a purpose.

397
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,040
- I work alone. 
- Not this time.

398
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,780
Don't make this personal.

399
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,360
Bourne betrayed us. 
It's always been personal.

400
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,820
[??? ] when you're ready.

401
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,330
-Yeah? 
- I need an assurance.

402
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,040
That I have your support.

403
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,290
[???], what do you have?

404
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,030
Kalloor,

405
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,360
is planning something, 
for Vegas.

406
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,000
LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM

407
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,220
- Yes? 
- This is Jason Bourne.

408
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,450
- I need to talk. 
- What about?

409
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:15,980
- I don't work for the Agency anymore. 
- Aubrey Plaza [???], 15 minutes.

410
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,400
Bourne just called Smith.

411
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:50,920
They're meeting at Aubrey Plaza,
15 minutes.

412
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,790
- 1:01:47.720 [???].

413
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,000
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne, 
I'll approach him.

414
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,640
Whatever you say, contain him.

415
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,520
I don't want the Brits falling
all over this asking questions.

416
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,980
Aye, sir.

417
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,610
Tracking device.

418
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,110
You'll hold on the south
side of the bridge.

419
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,620
I'll contact you if I need you.

420
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,000
Sure,

421
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,960
You're the boss, right?

422
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,600
- Subject is on the move. 
- I can [???] now.

423
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,310
Alpha Team take [???].

424
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,690
Bravo Team, pull up to the subject from
behind. You keep your eyes open for Bourne.

425
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,960
Bravo Team, tailing subjects.

426
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,020
- Let's go. At 200 meters, set your mark. 
- Copy that.

427
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:24,910
Comms check, second channel. 
Do you copy?

428
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,810
- I have you. Where are you now? 
- Heading towards the [???].

429
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,970
No sign of Bourne.

430
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,140
- Subject is turning east. 
- Into an alley.

431
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,910
Alpha Team, that alley leads to a foot-trail, 
which will lead him to you.

432
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,600
Copy that.

433
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:37,060
Bravo Team is down. The second update from now.

434
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,060
Copy that, Smith?

435
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,400
Yes.

436
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:04,480
Programs team, why aren't 
you moving? What's going on?

437
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,270
Programs team, do you copy?

438
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,730
What's happening, where is Bravo?

439
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:13,200
The comms down for Bravo.

440
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,280
Akpha Team do you have
eyes on the subject?

441
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,480
Alpha Team, sitprep?

442
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,620
- Alpha Team report. 
- What's happening Heather?

443
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:42,680
- Alpha Team isn't responding. 
- Bravo?

444
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,400
What's going on?

445
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:47,860
You lost both teams [??] this
operation, Heather. That's Bourne.

446
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,080
Bring out the asset.

447
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:53,260
- Sir, I need more time. 
- We have no time.

448
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,910
- Are you going to give that order or not? 
- Sir, please.

449
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:01,220
If you're too naive to see the trees, 
there's no bringing in Bourne.

450
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,520
He has to be put down.

451
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:08,000
And you obviously cannot do what has to
be done. I'm taking operational control.

452
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,220
- 1:06:03.00 [???].

453
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,540
- [???], you have green light on Bourne. 
- Copy that. I'm on my way.

454
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,330
Asset are you on the move?

455
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,880
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.

456
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,380
Are you moving?

457
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,370
Heaher stay off this channel,
let him do his job.

458
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,590
Left here. Get up to
Aubrey Plaza, fast.

459
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,840
In position.

460
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,240
Locked in.

461
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:01,000
- What's that alarm? 
- What's that noise?

462
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,940
- Lots of fire alarms. 
- That's Bourne.

463
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,790
- 1:08:04.94 [??? ].

464
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,520
- I can't see you, you can't protect me. 
- I need you to stay where you are, Smith.

465
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:33,010
We still have [???] on the side of me.

466
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,880
I'm on him.

467
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,310
Can you see me?  In the crowd?

468
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,280
Stay where you are, Smith.

469
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,470
You know why he's here. 
He wants the address.

470
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:47,840
We've lost the signal. 
I got to get out of here.

471
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,640
- What the hell's going on? 
- Bourne's got Smith.

472
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,060
Go after them.
I'll come along and come them off.

473
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:38,940
Smith, I know you're with Bourne. 
Find a way to let us know where you are.

474
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,740
- Why are you taking me in here? 
- 5th avenue, at the Plaza.

475
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,900
- Take it easy. 
- Jason Webb ..

476
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,260
- 1:09:58.90 [???], Beirut.

477
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,820
He was my father, 
he started Treadstone.

478
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,050
He hired you to put me under survellaince. 
Why?, Why did he hire you?

479
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,630
Or so you think, [???].

480
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,800
- What do you want us to do? 
- Work you way down to Canal.

481
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,960
I'll circle around and meet you there.

482
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:33,200
You followed my to Beirut. 
The last time I saw my father.

483
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,380
Why would he have you follow me?

484
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,580
It doesn't make any sense, why?

485
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,830
Don't give him a goddamn thing.

486
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,740
Why?

487
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,500
- 1:10:41.74 [???].

488
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,620
I can hear that.

489
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:00,300
I went there to tell you that 
Treadstone had approached me.

490
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,290
But if it was [???],
why didn't he say anything.

491
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,860
I've done something.

492
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,020
something ..

493
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,700
that came at a cost.

494
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,850
That was the day he was killed.

495
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,320
They said he was killed by terrorists.

496
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,210
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?

497
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,910
Think about your family's safety, Smith. 
and keep your mouth shut.

498
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,990
The nest bullet is in your head.

499
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,090
Why was he killed?

500
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,000
Why?

501
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,670
Jesus, just because of you.

502
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,660
Your father, 
he wasn't in operations.

503
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,200
He didn't really choose you, 
but when he found out

504
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,000
He threatened to expose the program.

505
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,570
He didn't want you turned into a killer.

506
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,010
Who killed him?

507
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,730
- Who killed him? 
- Don't do it.

508
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,840
Where is he?

509
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:17,010
He's almost there.

510
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,620
We're going to stop this now.

511
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,150
He went off the roof.
Tried to run. [???].

512
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,150
He recognized me.

513
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,410
I got to make sure it's finished. [???].

514
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,280
Step aside please, step aside.

515
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,210
- He's gone. - Oh, shit. 
- I'm going after him.

516
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,250
I'll work my way down the Canal.

517
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,630
No. You're done in London.

518
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:28,210
- What're you talking about? 
- There's another place [???].

519
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,110
Now he knows [???].

520
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,440
- 1:13:23.240 [???], 
Opportunity for something else.

521
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,650
- This isn't about revenge. 
- Yes, it is.

522
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,060
And it won't be done
till one of us is dead.

523
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,070
Get to the airport.

524
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,350
We have a problem with IronHand.

525
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,980
Copy that.

526
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:59,260
- Give me a sitrep. [ situation report ] 
- We've got nothing.

527
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,730
Keep looking.

528
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,130
Drive.

529
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,160
It wasn't supposed to go like this, I wanted to talk. 
- Where's Dewey going?

530
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:25,630
He's going to Vegas to speak with 
Aaron Kalloor to sign the [???].

531
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,860
Convention. The Agency recruits there every year.

532
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:31,090
What's Iron Hand?

533
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,480
Dewey's new black ops program.

534
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:38,260
Full-sprectrum surveillance.

535
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,290
[???] everyone, all the time.

536
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,960
Dewey needs Kalloor's
co-operation for the online

537
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,290
Let me out.

538
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,240
I can help you get there.

539
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,610
Why would you do that?

540
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:00,310
You and I have different reasons, 
but we both want  to [???].

541
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:06,650
Here, take this.

542
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,250
I'll see you in Vegas.

544
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,340
We're getting close hit on a 
fix on Shahadi's shooter [???]

545
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,480
- 1:15:51.34 [???].

546
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:57,370
We created bank accounts, travel 
documents, emails, phone records.

547
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,320
- It'll look like a lone wolf. 
- Any physical evidence?

548
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:03,370
[???] the gun, and rub
his fingerprints on it.

549
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:07,240
Russell doesn't need to know about this. 
(Director NI Edwin Russell)

550
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,370
I understand sir.

551
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,660
Any news on Bourne. [???]

552
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,420
Nothing.

553
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,190
He was always going to come for me.

554
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,720
Well, if it happens we'll deal with it.

558
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:35,740
- Welcome home, sir. 
- Thank you,

559
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,340
Sir, we have a secure room for you,
right upstairs.

- Enjoy your stay. 
- Thank you.

Hi, welcome to the REO Expo.

562
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,990
- I have arranged [???] check-in. 
- Okay.

563
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,230
We have you in a lovely sky-suite,
No 2016.

564
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:19,270
- Enjoy your stay. 
- Thank you.

565
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:50,990
- Find Lee, tell her I want to see her 
before we go upstairs.- Yes, sir.

566
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,340
I'm going to need men posted 
backstate as well as the auditorium.

01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:06,180
- You don't have much time. 
- They won't know where it came from.

570
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,510
I'll have enough time.

571
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:12,400
After you take care of Kalloor,
I'll be standing left-hand beside,

01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,600
You put a bullet in him, it's better,
auditorium too. [???]

Copy that.

strong supporter,

579
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,430
That's why I didn't know what to do
with you.  I suppose I could just, ah,

580
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,530
Write it  off to your .. learning curve.

581
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,690
I appreciate that.

582
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:16,300
I least you can now see
that you didn't have [???].

583
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,300
Or Bourne, [???].

584
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,820
I'll deal with him, do you understand?

585
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,720
Of course. 
I agree completely.

586
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,870
When you're on stage, [???].

587
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,610
- I'll be ready, sir. 
- Okay, let's do this.

- Aaron. 
- Robert.

589
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:09,600
You never met.

590
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:16,450
Yeah, we.. we went to Stanford together.

591
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,940
- How are you enjoying life at the Agency? 
- Challenging, but fulfilling.

592
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,670
[???], still your interest over there?

593
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,820
My principles are just fine, thanks.

Follow me, please.

Oh, hi. How's everyone doing tonight?

597

Welcome.

Welcome to tonight's EXOCON Symposium.

CIA Director, Robert Dewey

601

Dear friend of mine,

CEO social media giant DEEP 
DREAM, Aaron Kalloor is here.

603

[???], Personal rights vs Public safety.

604
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,490
This is the great question of our time.

605
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,920
And the choices we make about 
this will determine our future.

606
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:34,770
So let's just dive right in, okay?

607
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,570
Come on, you guys!

608
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,640
Sir, you have an incoming message.

609
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,450
- High priority.

610
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,340
Alright guys, I'm going 
to have to take this.

611

It appears Director Dewey settled 
down momentarily, and I mean

613
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,900
I'm told that it shouldn't
be too much longer,

614
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:18,040
But we have a ton of stuff to get into 
tonight, so I'm going to start anyway.

615
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,770
Craig, can I say a few words?

616
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,950
- Excuse me? 
- Can I get normal?

617
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,440
Oh, sure man. By all means. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.

618
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:38,790
Thank you, thanks a lot.

619
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:49,420
Before the Director comes 
 out to join us, I just

620
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,580
just wanted to share a
few words with you guys.

621
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,300
A long time ago, I,
I had this idea.

622
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:56,080
Copy that.

623
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:59,950
Facial recognition got a hit on [???]

624
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,390
He was [???] in Vegas like two hours ago.

625
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,230
- 1:28:02.39  [???]

626
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,660
Someone issued an Agency 
security clearance on his passport.

627
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:16,670
... people from aroun the world 
 started using our service,

628
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:27,280
<font color="#ff8080">SOMETHING's WRONG</font>

629
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:37,010
Come on stay, take care of
Kalloor, and the girl.

630
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,690
Copy.

631
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,690
What I want to say is, you know,

632
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,950
All this success has come at a cost,

633
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,200
There's a cancer at the heart

634
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:47,740
of DEEP DREAM,

635
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:50,060
A guilty secret,

636
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:52,740
and now, ah, now I have to share it

637
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:54,160
with all of you guys, so

638
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:57,320
Just have to take a [???]. Take  
out Kalloor and the girl right now.

639
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,370
I, took money to ah, start my company

640
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:16,160
and made a bargain with
the guy in the dark suit.

641
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:21,550
And now, he's come back to take my soul.

642
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,530
Sir, we got to go.

643
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,940
Get the cars ready.  
Get the cars ready, right now!

644
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,400
No. Take me to the suite.

645
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,880
Sir, we got to get you out of
here. Bourne is on the loose.

646
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,860
- You heard me. 
Take me to the suite. - Yes, sir.

647
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:12,390
Take to the suite. Take him upstairs.

648
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,780
Get him upstairs. Right now, right now.

649
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:16,540
Up to the suite.

650
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:40,280
Vasquez, sitrep. [SITUATION REPORT]. 
Vasquez.  Vasquez, come in.

651
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:43,880
Hey!

652
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:05,820
Okay, we got him, sir.  
We've ID'd the sniper.

653
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,400
- Shit! 
- We're circulating his photo now.

654
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,850
- What about Bourne? 
- Hang on.

655
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,450
Okay, Bourne is just leaving the west 
stairs corridor heading for the lobby.

656
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:17,280
Copy that.  Stay on Bourne.

657
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:24,310
- Horton. 
- We're still looking for Bourne. 
 They've ID'd the IAD asset.

658
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,700
Go back to the first floor, and wait for 
further instructions.- Yes, sir, copy that.

659
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,320
Stop right there. 
Put it down.

660
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,920
Move, move, move.

661
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:35,790
[???] to the northeast elevator, now.

662
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,170
Bourne is on his way up to you.

663
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,920
You took a long time to get here, Jason.

664
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,180
I know about Beirut.

665
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:42,520
I know what you did.

666
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,660
It all ends tonight.

667
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:48,600
It'll a lot easier if do it right away.

668
01:33:56,610 --> 01:34:00,000
You didn't come here for revenge. 
You came because it's time to come in.

669
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:13,430
Your father created the program. Didn't 
have what it takes to make it work.

670
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:15,320
And you did.

671
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,600
You always did.

672
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:24,320
- That's why you volunteered. - I volunteered 
because I thought terrorists killed Lou.

673
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,270
- I volunteered because of a lie. 
- No. You volunteered becasue of who you are.

674
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,350
You volunteered because 
you are Jason Bourne.

675
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:35,590
And, not, David Webb.

676
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,400
32 kills, Jason.

677
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,490
[???] 
people all across this country,

678
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:53,800
Are safer because of what you did.

679
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,860
- 1:34:53.80  [???].

680
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,390
I tried to find another way.

681
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:13,360
And how's that working out for you?

682
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,720
You didn't any peace.

683
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,940
NOt till you admit to
yourself, who you really are.

684
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,370
It's sudden death here, Jason.

685
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:35,510
Stop doing it.

686
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:42,990
- So? 
- I can't.

687
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,440
Not for you.

688
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:26,960
You were never here.

689
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:36,410
You don't have to walk.

690
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,280
This can stop now.

691
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,700
You have a choice.

692
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:12,690
[???] All units, suspect stole 
 a 2015 black dodge charger.

693
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,440
This is Air One, be advised, 
suspects vehicles have crashed

694
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:43,580
On the southeast entrance of the Riviera.

695
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,340
We have unkown a suspect heading 
to the storm-drain of the Riviera.

696
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,640
You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.

697
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,150
- 1:45:50.64 [???].

698
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:35,920
[???] work with the authorities, 
to find out who's responsible.

699
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:39,200
- 1:47:35.92 [???] .

700
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:40,860
Thank you.

701
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:15,120
Sir.

702
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:26,890
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

703
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:28,830
About Vegas.

704
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:32,880
I read that Dewey's tactics
were .. unwise.

705
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:34,180
Unwise.

706
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:38,700
We're still trying to come up with a 
narrative to explain what happened.

707
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:42,440
That son-of-a-bitch put 
a spotlight on our heads.

708
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,790
All of us.

709
01:48:45,110 --> 01:48:46,940
- 1:48:44.79 yet [???].

710
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,840
I know her. [???]

711
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:53,260
There's still moves we can make.

712
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:57,270
Tell me.

713
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,160
Dewey's problem was that 
he clung on to the past.

714
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:05,120
People are  [???]  the future.

715
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,140
These are my people.

716
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:09,800
I know what to do over.

717
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,040
and what do you want?

718
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,550
When you appoint someone head of your 
Agency, you're going to need someone,

719
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:21,650
Working [???].

720
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:23,590
Someone ...

721
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,960
An hour, [???].

722
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,050
By you, [???]

723
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:29,770
- 1:49:28.05- [???].

724
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,290
What about Bourne?

725
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:35,260
You still think you can bring him in?

726
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,740
I have his trust.

727
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:42,270
After all we've been through.

728
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,290
I'll bring him in.

729
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:47,280
I'm certain of it.

730
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,920
What if you can't?

731
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,010
Then ..

732
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:56,830
He'll have to be put down.

733
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,190
That's an interesting proposal.

734
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,400
You can pull over here.

735
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:16,640
Of course if you decide
you don't need me,

736
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:18,910
That's not a problem.

737
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,010
There are many other agencies 
that want what I know.

738
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,280
I brought you something.

739
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:02,510
It's a cast from you father's
star, on Memorial Wall.

740
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,320
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

741
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,630
I [???]. The people who did that, are gone.

742
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,300
And,

743
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:26,040
Things are changing in the Agency.

744
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,270
What is it you want?

745
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:33,200
I know you've always been a patriot.

746
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:37,300
And what happens to this 
country, matters to you.

747
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:41,040
We need you to help us protect it.

748
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:43,620
Come back in.

749
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,560
And we'll work together.

750
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,970
Let me think about it.

751
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,070
How will I find you.

752
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:48,230
You still think you can bring him in?

753
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:49,920
I have his trust.

754
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:52,810
After all we've been through.

755
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,920
I'll bring him in.

756
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:57,280
I'm certain of it.

757
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,520
And if you can't?

758
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,380
Then,

759
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:04,900
He'll have to be put down.

760
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:14,960
<font color="#d900d9">I"M NOT SURPRISED, MOTHERFUCKERS!</font>
