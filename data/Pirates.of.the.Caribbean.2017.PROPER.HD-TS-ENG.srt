00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:25,109
What do we do?

164
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,909
You need to scream.

165
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,589
Over there! Secure that woman!

166
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:40,029
- You filthy pirate!
- No need for name-calling!

167
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,909
Jack!

168
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:24,629
Bridge?

169
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,509
It's empty!

170
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,678
Where is the dosh?

171
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:04,749
Do you think that
robbing a bank is easy?

172
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,987
You gaggle of gutless eels,
are the ones guilty of

173
00:22:07,988 --> 00:22:10,349
putting me in this dreadful
pickle in the first place.

174
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:13,429
Now line up
and offer me a tribute.

175
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:16,029
You want us to pay YOU?!

176
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,149
Am I not the captain of this ship?

177
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,349
You call this a ship?

178
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,008
- Where's the treasure?
- All of us are starving.

179
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,358
We'll no longer follow a captain
without a ship.

180
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,709
I have a ship.

181
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,269
Black Pearl has never left me side.

182
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:36,349
The pirate Barbossa
rules these seas now.

183
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:39,349
Has 10 ships. Guns full.

184
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:43,158
Not to mention his canon balls.
18 pounds each they say.

185
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,349
One legged man with 18 pound balls?

186
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,469
That's why he walks funny.

187
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,448
Oh, come, come mates!

188
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:51,728
Did we not find the
treasure of Macedonia together?

189
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:53,488
It was a trawl of rotten wood.

190
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:56,109
- Gold of King Midas.
- Pile of donkey dung.

191
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:59,848
Face it Jack, bad luck dogs you,
day and night.

192
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,589
Now that is a blatant fabrication!

193
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:10,349
- You've lost your luck.
- You've lost your ship.

194
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,149
Now, you've lost your crew.

195
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:16,469
Jack Sparrow is no longer
our captain.

196
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:24,989
I'm sorry Jack. But we've
reached the end of the horizon.

197
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:37,909
Right, then!

198
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:39,909
You're all dismissed!

199
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:40,909
Eh?

200
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:43,149
All of ya, dismissed!

201
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:47,589
Never sail with Captain
Jack Sparrow again. Tell you that!

202
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,829
The whole town speaks of you.

203
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,488
The only survivor of the Moray.

204
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:44,098
A boy who peaddled all the way to St Martin,
against the tide, on a piece of driftwood.

205
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,989
Now, jabbering about pirates.

206
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,038
And tridents.

207
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,158
Please sir, let me go off these chains.

208
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,469
My job is to protect this island
and these waters.

209
00:24:55,199 --> 00:25:00,389
And your sleeves have been ripped;
the mark of treason.

210
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,429
- We were attacked by the dead.
- You're a coward who ran from battle.

211
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,069
And that is how you die.

212
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,678
- I don't believe you're a coward.
- Please leave me, Sister.

213
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,389
I've risked my life to come here,

214
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,509
to see if the rumors are true.

215
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,238
- You speak of the Trident?
- Who are you?

216
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:35,939
- Tell me why you seek the Trident?
- The Trident can break any curse at sea.

217
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,278
My father is trapped by such a curse.

218
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,638
You're aware that curses
are not supported by science.

219
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:44,739
- Neither are ghosts.
- So you have gone mad?

220
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,379
- I should never have come here.
- Then why did you come here?

221
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,828
Because I need to get off
this island, to solve the map...

222
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:54,259
...no man can read,
left by Poseidon himself.

223
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:00,059
- You've read the ancient texts?
- In each language they were written.

224
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,539
But this map has never been seen
nor read, by any man.

225
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,899
Luckily, I'm a woman.

226
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,339
This is the diary of Galileo Galilei.

227
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,958
He spent his life
searching for the Trident,

228
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,318
It's why he invented the spyglass.

229
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:22,419
Why astronomers have spent
their lives staring into the sky.

230
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,619
So you're saying,
the map no man can read,

231
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,318
is hidden in the stars?

232
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,578
It was left to me by my father.

233
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:32,918
He believed I could find
what no man has ever found.

234
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,459
I will not let him down.

235
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:37,638
Soon, there will be a Bloodmoon.

236
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:43,659
Only then can the map be read
and the Trident found. - Who are you?

237
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,519
Carina Smyth!

238
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,018
If you wish to save your father,
you'll have to save me.

239
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:51,519
Find us a ship
and the Trident will be ours.

240
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,299
Answer me Witch!

241
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,899
Oh!

242
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:07,939
He's gone!

243
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,219
He's gone, sir.

244
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,539
Find that coward.

245
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:17,019
He'll hang with the witch.

246
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,579
Think Cap'n Jack's washed up, eh?

247
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,099
I've not had a wash in years.

248
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,699
Check the alley down there.

249
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,859
You two, check the church.
The rest of you, with me!

250
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,099
Bugger!

251
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,918
- May I please have a drink, please?
- Show me your silver.

252
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,019
Silver?

253
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,619
How about a trade?

254
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,779
Give me the bottle.

255
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,219
<i>Capitán</i>!

256
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,539
What's happening?

257
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,819
Jack Sparrow, Jack Sparrow
has given away the compass.

258
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,499
Daylight! Daylight!

259
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,819
We are free!

260
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,499
Now, now, it's time,
to hunt a pirate.

261
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,699
Pirate's life.

262
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,699
Come to Daddy.

263
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:36,899
- Just the man we've been looking for.
- Why? Why am I looked for?

264
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:41,598
Let it be known that the pirate
Jack Sparrow will be executed at dawn.

265
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,939
Executed?

266
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,819
I will never set foot in this town
again, sir. Ye mark my word!

267
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,819
I do mean it.
I shall never be back here again!

268
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,539
To release the power of the sea.

269
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,699
One must divide.

270
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:46,219
It's an island.
The stars lead to an island.

271
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:06,699
- I'm looking for a pirate, Jack Sparrow.
- Bugger off!

272
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,179
I need to speak with you.

273
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,118
- Hand me your sword.
- I don't have a sword.

274
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,859
- What kind of soldier has no weapon?
- I'm currently wanted for treason.

275
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,558
So, not a very good kind.

276
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,339
I'm looking for a pirate,
Captain Jack Sparrow?

277
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:35,819
Today is your lucky day.
Because I just happen to be

278
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:39,259
Captain Jack Sparrow.

279
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,699
No, it can't be.

280
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,019
I've spent years searching for this?

281
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,939
The great Jack Sparrow is not some
drunk in a cell.

282
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:54,819
Do you even have a ship?
A crew?

283
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,699
Pants?

284
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,238
A great pirate does not require
such intricacies.

285
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,368
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for this moment?

286
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:05,518
The risks I've taken to be here?

287
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,888
- Are you sure you're the Jack Sparrow?
- The real question is, who are you?

288
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,579
My name is Henry Turner.

289
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,939
Son of Will Turner and Elisabeth Swann.

290
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,819
You're the evil spawn of them two?

291
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,998
- Does mommy ever ask about me?
- No.

292
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:24,508
Go on! Does she calls my name
in her sleep?

293
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,059
She never spoke of you.

294
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,219
Are you sure we're talking
about the same people?

295
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,179
He's a chaste eunuch.

296
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,878
She's a golden haired, stubborn,

297
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:37,038
pouty lips, neck like a giraffe,

298
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,059
- and two of the most wonderful...
- Yes, yes, it's her!

299
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,259
I need you to listen Jack, because
at the moment you're all I've got.

300
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,218
I found a way to save my father.

301
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,079
There is one thing that can break his curse
and free him from the Dutchman.

302
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,859
The Trident of Poseidon.

303
00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:01,459
The treasure that can be found with
the map that no man can read.

304
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:05,779
Never heard of it.

305
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,859
There is a girl inside this prison,
Jack, who holds that map.

306
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:12,939
The moon has turned to blood,
the Trident will be found.

307
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,918
And you could be the one
who holds the sea,

308
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,988
and with it become all
that you once were.

309
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,089
The great...

310
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,979
Jack!

311
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:25,719
Oh, I'm so sorry, were you still talking?
I believe I nodded off, there.

312
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:28,139
One more thing.

313
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:31,539
A message from someone you know,
named Captain Salazar.

314
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,859
I once knew a Spaniard named...

315
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:39,299
...something in Spanish.

316
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,819
<i>El Matador Del Mar</i>,
The Butcher of the Sea.

317
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,798
Him? No, no. Quite happily, he's dead.

318
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:49,278
Very, very, dead. Ship went down!

319
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:50,659
Inside the triangle.

320
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,179
He's coming for you Jack, to seek revenge,
as the dead man's tale is told.

321
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,859
I don't believe you.

322
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,558
What did he say?

323
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,188
He said your compass was
the key to his escape.

324
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:05,939
An army of dead are coming
straight for you, Jack.

325
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,579
The Trident of Poseidon
is your only hope.

326
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:12,099
Do we have an accord?

327
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:24,028
I'm not going in there to tell him.
It was your idea.

328
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:27,108
No, it was my idea for you
to tell him.

329
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:30,699
- He likes you more than me.
- He doesn't like anybody.

330
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:56,508
Sorry, sir, we know you said
never to disturb you,

331
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:58,508
or to come in without good cause.

332
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:00,419
Or to speak without first...

333
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:06,259
asking ourselves whether our
thoughts were absolutely necessary.

334
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,428
Like the time the ship was on fire.

335
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:10,548
That being an example
of necessary thought.

336
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:13,819
So, again, we do apologize
for starting that fire.

337
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:21,769
Speak!

338
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:27,828
It's the ships, sir, they're being attacked
by an enemy that takes their Riches.

339
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,508
Kills without provocation.

340
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:32,348
My ships?! Not possible.

341
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:34,609
Three have already been sunk, Sir.

342
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:37,489
They've been sunk by a captain
called Salamander.

343
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,049
Samovar.

344
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,809
Salazar!

345
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,578
That's it, your Sirness!

346
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:46,508
He leaves one man from each vessel
to tell the tale.

347
00:37:46,509 --> 00:37:49,849
The entire fleet is being sunk,

348
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,889
and will soon be dead.

349
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:56,249
And quite possibly out of business.

350
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:05,329
I'll be needing some time
with your witch.

351
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:24,929
I've been expecting you Captain.
Perhaps you'd like some tea.

352
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:30,929
I shall pass, thank you kindly.

353
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:35,569
The price of crossing my door
is blood, Captain.

354
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:39,469
That explains why you're not so busy.

355
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:42,169
Everyone pays, eventually.

356
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:46,249
Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.

357
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:48,948
I saved you from the gallows,
remember?

358
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:51,369
And I cursed your enemies.

359
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:53,948
But now you come to me in fear,

360
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:57,228
as the dead are taking
command of the sea.

361
00:38:57,229 --> 00:39:00,548
And what would the dead
be wanting with me?

362
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:02,769
Not you, Captain.

363
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:06,809
- They're searching for a Sparrow.
- Jack?

364
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:15,849
Jack who sails for the Trident
with a girl and a Pearl.

365
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:19,489
The Trident can never be found.

366
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:25,649
The Trident is Jack's only hope.

367
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:30,049
The dead are conquering the sea,
unable to step on dry land.

368
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:35,969
Maybe you should retire
to the countryside.

369
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:40,229
Do you mean grass?

370
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,429
On a farm?

371
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,449
Milking a cow? Making cheese?

372
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:51,249
- While they sink me treasure?
- Ask yourself this, Captain.

373
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:56,309
- Is this treasure worth dying for?
- I'm a pirate.

374
00:39:56,629 --> 00:40:00,969
Always will be.
So how do I save, what be mine?

375
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:05,529
Jack held a compass, which points
you to the thing you desire most.

376
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:07,729
But, betray the compass,

377
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:10,308
and it releases your greatest fear.

378
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:14,018
And a pirate's greatest
fear'd be Salazar, is it?

379
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:20,689
- How did you get this?
- I have my ways.

380
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,849
Lead them to Jack
before he finds the Trident.

381
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:27,729
And all your treasure
will come back to you.

382
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:31,769
Time to make a deal
with the dead.

383
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:36,769
Come on, pirate.

384
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:45,129
Hold on, stop.

385
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:54,148
- Uncle Jack!
- Jackie boy, how's it goin'?

386
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:55,988
Can't complain, really. You?

387
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:58,449
I've been waiting all morning in here,
for a beating.

388
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:01,449
- But the service is terrible.
- Shameful.

389
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:03,009
Jack.

390
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:07,108
The oceans have turned to blood.

391
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:10,129
Best stay on dry land,
where it's safe.

392
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:14,788
- I'm about to be executed on dry land.
- Good point.

393
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:17,049
Did I ever tell you the one
about the skeleton?

394
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:18,388
Yes you have, many times.

395
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:22,649
Skeleton goes into a bar,
orders a beer and a mop.

396
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:26,009
Funny as ever.

397
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,649
Come on, let's go!

398
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:34,049
If they disembowel you, ask for Victor.
He's got the softest hands.

399
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:35,028
Thank you.

400
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:37,929
And mention my name,
they won't cut your feet off.

401
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,809
Come on, you're first!

402
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:06,028
How would you like to die, pirate?

403
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:10,028
Hanging, firing squad or
a new invention,

404
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:12,369
- the guillotine.
- Guillotine?

405
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:14,918
Sounds french. I love the French.

406
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:17,009
Did you know that they
invented mayonnaise?

407
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:19,369
How bad could it be?
It's French, right?

408
00:42:23,029 --> 00:42:25,569
Oh, my bad, I changed me mind!

409
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:34,929
No please have mercy upon me.
I, I'm a bed-wetter.

410
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:55,868
Oh, come on! I mean I have to
walk upstairs as well for this?

411
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:59,489
- Bring the basket.
- Basket, why?

412
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:02,289
Strap him down!

413
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:12,609
Here's an idea.
Here's an idea.

414
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:16,889
Why don't we try good old fashioned stoning, eh?
I'd kill to be stoned right now.

415
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:18,929
Gets the crowd involved, doesn't it?

416
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:21,108
I should like to speak to Victor,
in disembowelment.

417
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:22,409
I should like to speak to Vic...

418
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:26,089
I, I'm not one to complain, normally,

419
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:28,289
but this basket's full of heads.

420
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:41,249
Final words of Carina Smyth. QUIET!

421
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,889
The final words of Carina Smyth,

422
00:43:48,229 --> 00:43:50,628
who says, I'm not a witch.

423
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,089
But I forgive your common dim
wittedness and feeble brains.

424
00:43:54,149 --> 00:43:56,298
In short,
most of you have the mind of a goat.

425
00:43:56,299 --> 00:44:00,268
Pardon me sir, is it not common practice,
for those about to be executed,

426
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:02,948
to be granted a last,
I don't know, something or other?

427
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:05,809
I believe I was making a point.
If you could just be patient.

428
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:07,209
No!

429
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,228
My head's about to be lopped off,
hence the urgency.

430
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:11,748
And my neck is to be broken.

431
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,468
Did you know that on occasion,
the neck doesn't actually break.

432
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:17,529
- It just hurts.
- What? - Oh Yes.

433
00:44:17,749 --> 00:44:19,348
I have seen men swing for hours.

434
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:20,948
Eyes bulging, tongues swelling.

435
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,028
- Revolting gurgling sound.
- May I finish?

436
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:26,209
No! You're lucky. Wish I was hung.

437
00:44:27,029 --> 00:44:29,668
- Kill the filthy pirate, I'll wait.
- The witch is first.

438
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:31,668
I'm not a witch.
Did not you listen?

439
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,818
Quite hard to listen
when you have the mind of a goat.

440
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:35,628
Enough! Kill them both.

441
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:37,129
Yes!

442
00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:01,289
Get another noose.
Did you think you could defeat us, boy?

443
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:04,089
No sir, I'm just a diversion.

444
00:45:04,629 --> 00:45:06,289
FIRE!

445
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,449
Still rather be stoned!

446
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:40,449
Reload!

447
00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:01,369
Thank you.

448
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:13,668
C'mere, you pirate scum!

449
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:14,769
Hey!

450
00:46:23,669 --> 00:46:25,849
What you doin'?
No, no, no, no!

451
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:37,869
Horses?

452
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:58,249
- Thank you.
- You're welcome Milady.

453
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:01,129
Got you!

454
00:47:06,749 --> 00:47:08,748
Knew you'd come crawling back, traitor!

455
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:12,569
The Turner boy gave us
10 silver pieces to save your neck.

456
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:21,338
From this moment on,
we are to be allies.

457
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,788
Considering where your left hand is,
I'd say we're more than that.

458
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:25,908
We'll find the Trident together.
Do I have your word?

459
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,849
You're holding everything but my word.

460
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:31,569
Then I bestow upon you the honor
of saving me, for a small donation.

461
00:47:31,669 --> 00:47:34,129
You expect us to pay you,
to save you?

462
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:36,609
Yes!

463
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:39,929
For a mere 10 pieces.

464
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:47,329
Madness!

465
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:51,449
- We won't pay more than 5!
- Well, then, 8 it is.

466
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,998
Perhaps we could discuss this later,
as I'm having trouble hoisting your port.

467
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:58,758
- You're far from port, that is my stern.
- Are you sure? - Positive.

468
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:01,049
Well, look at this!

469
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:04,538
If I kill the coward, the witch hangs.

470
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:07,498
- Two for the price of one.
- Please don't let go of me.

471
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:09,669
Might be difficult once he kills me.

472
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:19,769
Gentlemen, these two prisoners
will lead us to the Trident.

473
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:25,778
- Captain. - Hm? - Do you really
think we can find the Trident?

474
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:29,809
Master Gibbs, you old worrywart,
there's nothing to be concerned about, at all.

475
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:35,038
What could possibly go wrong, eh?

476
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,098
So this was your plan?
To be tortured and killed by pirates?

477
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,418
- You said you needed a ship.
- You call this a ship?

478
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:41,929
Cut the shaft!

479
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:52,489
Prepare the crows.

480
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,079
My dear beloved crew, finally, today is...

481
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,739
Something's gone wrong.

482
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:45,479
She floats!

483
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:51,359
Ship, dead ahead!

484
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:05,098
Sir. We would never
question your reason as a captain.

485
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:06,399
But, uh,

486
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:09,458
is there a reason, as captain,

487
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:11,799
you've chosen to sail in this
unreasonable direction?

488
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:17,679
Tell the men to prepare to be boarded,
to stand their ground and show no fear.

489
00:50:23,259 --> 00:50:26,919
<i>Capitán</i>! A ship sails toward us.

490
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:57,039
<i>Capitán</i> Salazar, I hear you've
been looking for Jack Sparrow.

491
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,999
Hold point!

492
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:26,479
And await orders.

493
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:50,978
My name's Captain Barbossa
I stand before you,

494
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:54,439
- with cordial intent.
- I don't need any cordial intent.

495
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:58,599
Do you hear that?
The pirate wishes to be cordial.

496
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,418
So let me show you
what my cordiality is, <i>hombre.</i>

497
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,719
Every time I tap my sword.

498
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,519
One of your men will die,
so I suggest you speak quickly.

499
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:10,719
<i>Oye ahí!</i>

500
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:15,359
Might want to go a bit faster <i>Capitán</i>.

501
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:22,678
- Where is Jack Sparrow?
- Jack be sailing for the Trident.

502
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,308
- No, the sea belongs to the dead.
- The Trident controls the seas.

503
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,858
No, no! There's no treasure.

504
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:32,738
There's no treasure
that can save him.

505
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:34,178
He will die, as will you.

506
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:36,559
I be the only one
that can lead you to him.

507
00:52:38,059 --> 00:52:41,378
I declare you shall have
Jack's life by sunrise on the morrow,

508
00:52:41,379 --> 00:52:44,799
or you can take me own then.
Do we have an accord?

509
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:55,239
Take me to him and you will live
to tell the tale.

510
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:57,519
You have my word.

511
00:52:57,579 --> 00:53:00,999
I thank you on behalf of me crew.

512
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:09,999
Olé! You can take what's left them.
The living, come aboard!

513
00:53:18,219 --> 00:53:22,058
Carina, we haven't got much time,
the dead are sailing straight for us.

514
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:24,378
- Is that so?
- Yes, I've spoken to them.

515
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:25,418
You spoken to them?

516
00:53:25,419 --> 00:53:27,719
Have you spoken to the Krakens
and the mermaids as well?

517
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:29,918
Krakens don't speak, everyone knows that.
- Of course.

518
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:32,039
I never should have saved you.

519
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:35,338
Last night there was a Bloodmoon,
just as you described.

520
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:38,079
- Tell me what it revealed.
- Why should I trust you?

521
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:41,138
You trusted me to hold your port,
remember? - It was my stern.

522
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:43,098
Clearly you need to spend
more time at sea.

523
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:45,378
Tell me what you found
and I promise to help you.

524
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:48,079
- I don't need any help.
- Then why did come to me Carina?

525
00:53:48,419 --> 00:53:51,639
Why are we tied together in the middle
of the sea, chasing the same treasure?

526
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:56,359
The moon revealed a clue.

527
00:53:56,539 --> 00:54:00,889
To release the power of the sea,
one must divide.

528
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,399
Divide?

529
00:54:02,459 --> 00:54:06,239
- What does it mean?
- I'm not sure yet.

530
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:09,639
Then we'll find out.

531
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:14,599
- There is no map in this map.
- Give me my diary.

532
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,998
Give me the map no man can read.

533
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:20,738
If you could read it, then it wouldn't
be called 'the map no man can read'.

534
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:22,799
I beg you please,
don't argue with her.

535
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:25,159
Most of the men on this ship can't read.

536
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:29,658
Which makes all maps,
'maps that no man can read'.

537
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:32,479
Well if you can't read it,
then you have no use for it, or me.

538
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:36,919
Let me start again.
Show me the map.

539
00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:39,679
I can't. It doesn't yet exist.

540
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:42,919
- She's a witch!
- I'm an astronomer.

541
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:47,378
- She breeds donkeys.
- What? No.

542
00:54:47,379 --> 00:54:51,088
- An astronomer contemplates the sky.
- Yeah, on a donkey!

543
00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:54,839
- No, there's no donkey!
- Well then how do you breed then?

544
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:59,319
Allows me to simplify this equation.
Give me the map...

545
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:06,559
or I will kill him.
I'll kill him.

546
00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:11,679
Go on then. You're bluffing.

547
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:14,559
And you're blushing.

548
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:17,599
Throw him over.

549
00:55:21,979 --> 00:55:24,119
We call this keelhauling.

550
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:27,359
Young Henry will be tossed over,

551
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:31,279
and he will be dragged under the ship.

552
00:55:31,419 --> 00:55:32,559
Alright.

553
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:36,079
- What're you waiting for?
- He doesn't appear to be bluffing.

554
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:39,319
No. Not bluffing, me.
He's trying to say something.

555
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:42,199
No, no, we don't have any
food aboard. Sorry.

556
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:47,679
If he's lucky, he'll drown before
the barnacles shred him to ribbons.

557
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:50,018
- Barnacles?
- Like a thousand knives across your back.

558
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:53,788
'Course, the blood attracts sharks.
- Sharks?

559
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:56,159
- Shark off the bow!
- Where?

560
00:55:56,379 --> 00:55:59,679
I would say that swimming
is no longer his primary concern.

561
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:01,359
The map is there.

562
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:03,898
- Where?
- On the tip of your finger?

563
00:56:03,899 --> 00:56:06,338
No. In the heavens.

564
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:09,218
That diary will lead me to a map,
hidden in the stars.

565
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:11,999
Let him up, I'll find it tonight.

566
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:13,738
Sorry, can't bring him up.

567
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:15,159
Look for yourself.

568
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:21,339
As I said: blushing!

569
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,799
Filthy pirate!

570
00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:35,288
The sea has turned to blood.

571
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:38,488
A sailor washed ashore
talking about the Trident.

572
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:40,479
He was looking for Jack Sparrow.

573
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:43,439
The same pirate who saved a witch
from the gallows.

574
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,839
- She's no witch.
- But you are.

575
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:52,119
- And you're going to help us.
- You're afraid, Lieutenant.

576
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:56,719
As ships burn in the night, you want
to know if you can save your own.

577
00:56:57,659 --> 00:57:00,399
If the Trident is real.

578
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:04,439
You're going to read that
wall for me, or you will die.

579
00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:08,798
The British Empire will have
the Trident and rule the sea.

580
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,879
I want to know where that
pirate is going with that witch.

581
00:57:12,939 --> 00:57:17,559
Your destiny is in these stars.
I will set your course.

582
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:44,719
Oh! Spaghetti balls!

583
00:57:45,779 --> 00:57:47,439
Why did I bother coming to you?

584
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:49,839
The dead are hunting us down
and you do nothing.

585
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:53,498
- Nothing? You call this nothing?
- You're drunk and you're sleeping!

586
00:57:53,499 --> 00:57:57,479
My point exactly,
I'm doing two things at once.

587
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:00,199
You can't save the unsaveable mate.

588
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,578
Like it or not, Jack,
you're going to help me.

589
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:05,639
I will break my father's curse.

590
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:10,359
Next time you raise a sword, boy...

591
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:13,399
be the last to die.

592
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:33,479
Might I suggest you entice her
with a bit of flattery.

593
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,519
I am here for my father, nothing more.

594
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:40,199
I knew it, absolutely
smitten with'er.

595
00:58:40,779 --> 00:58:44,338
Now, a bit of discretion
when courting a brunette.

596
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:46,218
Never pursue her sister.

597
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:49,759
But, if you cannot avoid
the charming sister,

598
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:52,359
kill the brother, savvy?

599
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:55,879
No, I do not savvy.

600
00:58:57,819 --> 00:58:59,278
Who hurt you?

601
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:04,648
By the way that little sliver
of knowledge, cost you five pieces.

602
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:07,719
- I'm not paying you for that!
- Never say that to a woman.

603
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:25,879
Just because you can't see something
doesn't mean it's not there.

604
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:28,779
Like the map?

605
00:59:30,339 --> 00:59:32,399
We have to find it.

606
00:59:32,999 --> 00:59:37,839
It's the only link to who I am.
Who my father was.

607
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:41,559
So we've both spent our lives,
searching for our fathers.

608
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:45,029
Perhaps you and I
are closer than you think.

609
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:04,399
The sun is up and so is your time.

610
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:10,988
Not to disagree, but, the precision
of our accord ends at sunrise.

611
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:14,248
This be the first light,
far from a fully rising sun.

612
01:00:14,249 --> 01:00:17,848
- And I know you to be a man of honor.
- Honor. You know nothing of me.

613
01:00:17,849 --> 01:00:20,368
I know what it's like to be
bested by Jack Sparrow.

614
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:23,799
- He's an enemy to us both.
- You don't know who I am.

615
01:00:25,129 --> 01:00:30,128
I've heard stories of a mighty
Spanish captain. <i>El Matador Del Mar.</i>

616
01:00:30,129 --> 01:00:34,208
A man who scourged the sea,
hunted and killed thousands of men.

617
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:36,669
No-no-no. Men, no. No!

618
01:00:37,249 --> 01:00:39,079
Pirates! Eh?

619
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:42,719
Pirates.

620
01:00:48,049 --> 01:00:51,408
Pirates had infected the seas
for generations,

621
01:00:51,409 --> 01:00:54,728
taking the life of my father
and his father before.

622
01:00:54,729 --> 01:00:58,388
So I vowed to end this plague
once and for all.

623
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:01,909
And that's what I did.
I destroyed dozens of ships.

624
01:01:07,529 --> 01:01:11,949
The last ones joined together
to try and defeat ME.

625
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:15,029
But they soon realized
it was hopeless.

626
01:01:26,609 --> 01:01:29,349
Nothing could stop the Silent Mary.

627
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:33,429
Hit them below the water line.
<i>Vamo, vamo!</i>

628
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:38,789
Hang on boys!

629
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:50,989
The sea was finally pure.

630
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:55,769
Their wretched flags
would no longer stain the sea.

631
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:05,589
They are begging for mercy.

632
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,469
Mercy? Mercy?

633
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,309
There's no mercy.

634
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:19,749
Make ready...

635
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,378
<i>Adios!</i>

636
01:02:27,379 --> 01:02:29,069
FIRE!

637
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:39,789
It's up to you now Jack.

638
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:46,069
This compass points towards
what you want most.

639
01:02:48,129 --> 01:02:51,069
Never betray it.

640
01:03:22,129 --> 01:03:24,549
The Devil's Triangle.

641
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:30,589
The last of their ships were
burning before my eyes.

642
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:36,269
And in that moment of victory,

643
01:03:36,509 --> 01:03:38,689
it's when I heard it.

644
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,079
Hey!

645
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:42,349
Hold on, <i>Capitán</i>!

646
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,829
One ship was trying to escape
through the smoke.

647
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:48,429
It's a lovely day for a sail, innit?

648
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:55,128
And there, in the crow's nest,
there was this young pirate boy.

649
01:03:55,129 --> 01:03:57,808
The way I see it,
it's just the two of us left.

650
01:03:57,809 --> 01:04:00,688
You surrender to me now,
and I'll let you live. Simple.

651
01:04:00,689 --> 01:04:04,109
He stood there, looking like
a little bird.

652
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:08,174
And from that day he earned himself
a name that would haunt me

653
01:04:08,175 --> 01:04:10,229
for the rest of my days:

654
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:13,809
Jack the Sparrow.

655
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:18,009
Right then, you surrender to me
now and I'll let you live.

656
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:21,269
I shall let you live.

657
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:31,248
This boy...
This boy was mocking my power.

658
01:04:31,249 --> 01:04:36,388
So I chased him, knowing that
I would run my knife along his neck

659
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:41,079
and when he was dead, I would finish,
finally, with the pirates's life.

660
01:04:45,529 --> 01:04:47,279
Follow him in!

661
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:50,869
To the gallows!
Grab some lines!

662
01:04:53,209 --> 01:04:54,829
Prepare the bootleg!

663
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:55,989
Port side.

664
01:04:58,129 --> 01:04:59,349
Throw it now!

665
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:23,029
Bootleg curve!

666
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:33,749
What's all this?

667
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:39,549
Tribute, Sir.

668
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:11,469
He took everything from me,

669
01:07:11,789 --> 01:07:14,989
and filled me with rage...

670
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:19,329
and pain.

671
01:07:20,729 --> 01:07:23,549
And here's where the tale ends.

672
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:30,969
Not yet, <i>Capitán</i>.
There! Found, as promised.

673
01:07:54,729 --> 01:07:58,288
So she's saying she's got the map,
but she's the only one who can follow it?

674
01:07:58,289 --> 01:08:00,728
- So, we should shoot her?
- Leave her be.

675
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:03,408
- She will take us to the Trident.
- You've been saying that for hours.

676
01:08:03,409 --> 01:08:07,029
Two things we know are true,
the stars don't shine by day.

677
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:08,949
And she forgot a donkey.

678
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:13,514
How can we go to a spot,
where no land exists on any map?

679
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:17,749
This chronometer
keeps the exact time in London.

680
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:21,349
I'm using it to make an altitude
measurement to determine longitude.

681
01:08:21,809 --> 01:08:24,368
Only then will we find
our exact spot at sea.

682
01:08:24,369 --> 01:08:26,989
So you expect to find the Trident
with a timepiece?

683
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:28,149
Yes.

684
01:08:28,769 --> 01:08:30,949
My calculations are precise and true.

685
01:08:31,169 --> 01:08:32,568
I'm not only an Astronomer,

686
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:34,189
I'm also a horologist.

687
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:40,989
No shame in that, dear.

688
01:08:41,169 --> 01:08:44,469
I mean, we all have to earn a living, eh?

689
01:08:45,929 --> 01:08:48,918
No, I'm a horologist.

690
01:08:48,919 --> 01:08:51,949
So was my mum, but, she didn't
cry about it as loud as you.

691
01:08:52,089 --> 01:08:54,488
Are you saying, your mother
was academically inclined?

692
01:08:54,489 --> 01:08:58,989
More like a horizontally, reclined.

693
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,288
Horology is the study of time.

694
01:09:02,289 --> 01:09:04,549
And she was always looking at her watch.

695
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:05,989
I can vouch for that.

696
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:12,168
- So, no one can find the X,
but you, right? - No.

697
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:14,909
- And the donkey?
- Ship to the aft!

698
01:09:16,929 --> 01:09:18,529
Salazar.

699
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:24,888
Jack, the dead will not rest
until they get their revenge.

700
01:09:24,889 --> 01:09:25,928
Dead?!

701
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:28,638
No, no, the dead were never
part of this deal.

702
01:09:28,639 --> 01:09:31,808
We should'a never follow a
luckless pirate and a witch to sea.

703
01:09:31,809 --> 01:09:33,709
Right, that's it. Kill them all.

704
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:37,589
Kill me and, and I'll be dead.

705
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:42,109
And then the other dead won't
be able to have their revenge.

706
01:09:42,969 --> 01:09:46,288
- Against me... Being dead.
- What?

707
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:48,238
- Which will anger them even more.
- He's right.

708
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:49,109
That's right.

709
01:09:49,169 --> 01:09:53,069
Are all pirates this stupid?
- Yes.

710
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:54,789
What are we going to do?

711
01:09:55,489 --> 01:09:59,629
As Captain, might I suggest...

712
01:10:04,129 --> 01:10:06,248
Mutiny?!
You had to suggest mutiny?

713
01:10:06,249 --> 01:10:07,808
Carina, the dead are coming.

714
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:11,248
Well, I choose not to believe in
supernatural nonsense.

715
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:12,989
Do you not see what's behind us?

716
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:28,728
- Drop them!
- <i>Si.</i>

717
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:30,109
Drop them!

718
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:38,088
What're you doing?

719
01:10:38,089 --> 01:10:40,878
Men on that ship are looking for Jack.
And Jack is on this boat.

720
01:10:40,879 --> 01:10:42,308
I'm going to swim for it.

721
01:10:42,309 --> 01:10:45,149
How dare you do exactly
what I would do, if I were you?

722
01:10:45,169 --> 01:10:47,829
- Carina, stop.
- No-no-no, don't stop.

723
01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:50,349
- This has gone far enough.
- No, it has not!

724
01:10:50,769 --> 01:10:53,789
Listen not to him,
carry on, carry on!

725
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:03,448
- Why, she was almost finished.
- I saw her ankles.

726
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:06,069
You'd have seen a lot more,
if you'd kept yer cakehole shut.

727
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,969
Kill the Sparrow.

728
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,509
That's not good, is it?

729
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:48,029
Keep rowing man. Faster, faster!

730
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:50,229
No, that's it!

731
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:52,809
I'm going with her.

732
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:56,558
You would leave me for some
horologist in her knickers?

733
01:11:56,559 --> 01:11:58,079
Yes.

734
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:00,929
You men are all alike.

735
01:12:10,819 --> 01:12:12,419
Shark.

736
01:12:36,959 --> 01:12:38,349
Henry!

737
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:03,979
- Doesn't seem to be working.
- No, we'll be fine, we'll be fine!

738
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:11,979
<i>Vamo!

739
01:13:23,639 --> 01:13:25,958
- How do they do that?
- We have to swim for it.

740
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:28,422
I'll distract them.

741
01:13:33,559 --> 01:13:35,088
Now!

742
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:55,088
Shoo!

743
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,939
Henry!

744
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:10,539
Hey, Jack Sparrow.

745
01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:14,048
Jack 'Esparrow'.

746
01:15:14,049 --> 01:15:15,519
Spanish?

747
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:23,488
No, no... Ghosts!

748
01:15:23,489 --> 01:15:25,079
Ohh...

749
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:28,659
They're unable to step on land.
I knew that, though.

750
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,299
Ghosts! Aahh!

751
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:34,278
Carina!

752
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,958
You will soon pay for what you did to me.

753
01:15:36,959 --> 01:15:39,368
No-no-no. There's no
need to bother, really.

754
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:40,398
Carina!

755
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:43,158
I have no time to chat,
because me map just ran away.

756
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:45,059
I will be waiting for you.

757
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:48,619
Why would he be waiting for me?
Why would he be waiting for me?

758
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:06,579
Pirates!

759
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:23,538
- Scrum.
- Captain?

760
01:16:23,539 --> 01:16:24,998
Jack always told me that

761
01:16:24,999 --> 01:16:28,668
if anything should ever happen
to him, he wanted you to be captain.

762
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:31,678
Yeah, but the men voted for you, yes?
Well, you've got a captain's hat!

763
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,278
Be that as it may, them were his wishes.
So be a good lad and take the wheel.

764
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:40,499
And you, take the captain's hat.

765
01:16:40,599 --> 01:16:44,019
Oh, it's the proudest moment of my l...

766
01:16:46,959 --> 01:16:48,758
We will beat your captain to death,

767
01:16:48,759 --> 01:16:50,779
until he reveals where they're heading.

768
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:56,518
- Carina!
- I know what's ailing you boy.

769
01:16:56,519 --> 01:16:58,739
You've got the unscratchable itch.

770
01:16:58,999 --> 01:17:01,699
Carina is the only one
who can help us find the Trident.

771
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:04,019
- And I'm not in love with her.
- Love?

772
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:06,278
Who said anything about love,
what are you talking about?

773
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:07,419
The unscratchable itch?

774
01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:09,798
Scabies, I'm talking about scabies.

775
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:12,139
Small mites that burrow under the skin.

776
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:14,318
Certainly annoying me,
has done, for years.

777
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:15,539
Oh, no!

778
01:17:18,119 --> 01:17:19,379
Help!

779
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:22,739
- Help me! Help!
- Carina!

780
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:26,379
- Henry, help me.
- Help her!

781
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:31,459
By rule of the King,
I sentence you all to death.

782
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:36,758
I think we should tell each other
where our treasures are buried,

783
01:17:36,759 --> 01:17:38,798
just in case one of us survives.

784
01:17:38,799 --> 01:17:40,139
Oh, good idea.

785
01:17:40,519 --> 01:17:43,718
- You go first.
- My treasure is buried

786
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:47,338
between two crossed palm trees
in an unmarked grave in Aruba.

787
01:17:47,339 --> 01:17:49,059
What about yours?

788
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:51,158
I haven't got any.

789
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:54,379
- You promised me Jack's blood.
- But Jack be trapped!

790
01:17:54,759 --> 01:17:58,489
- He can never escape that island.
- HE'S ON LAND!

791
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,779
Hello.

792
01:18:09,799 --> 01:18:13,379
I upheld our deal.
Me men and meself will go ashore.

793
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,828
The scurvy traitor
will be yours, on me honor.

794
01:18:16,829 --> 01:18:18,358
Honor?!

795
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:20,459
What honor, <i>hombre?</i> What honor?

796
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:22,088
You don't know what honor is.

797
01:18:22,089 --> 01:18:25,819
Spare me my life
and I'll fetch you the Sparrow.

798
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:29,579
First we must swear, though, an accord.

799
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,379
<i>Wake up Sparrow.</i>

800
01:18:50,599 --> 01:18:53,459
<i>Wake up Sparrow.</i>

801
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,859
Wake up, Sparrow.

802
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:00,138
It's time to pay your debt.

803
01:19:00,139 --> 01:19:03,559
Pig?... Pig Kelly?

804
01:19:04,099 --> 01:19:07,459
- Me old mate.
- Mate?!

805
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:09,459
D'you hear that boys?

806
01:19:09,699 --> 01:19:13,158
This lyin' pirate owes me
a blunder of silver.

807
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:16,198
And luck has brought him to
Hangman's Bay,

808
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:19,299
where he can settle his debt,
here and now.

809
01:19:20,119 --> 01:19:23,238
And I will, I will, Pig.
Name your price.

810
01:19:23,239 --> 01:19:26,139
Her name is Beatrice.

811
01:19:28,999 --> 01:19:31,619
And she's my poor widowed sister.

812
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:35,718
W-what is that?

813
01:19:35,719 --> 01:19:38,079
She's been looking for
a respectable man.

814
01:19:38,599 --> 01:19:41,299
- But you'll have to do.
- Right, let's get on with this.

815
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:45,718
- No! Why? Why?
- To make an honest woman of her, Jack.

816
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:48,579
Congratulations, it's your weddin' day.

817
01:19:49,799 --> 01:19:50,798
Let us begin?

818
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,659
We'll honeymoon in the barn.

819
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:01,478
No-no-no. Now, Pig,
how could I honestly make

820
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:06,079
an honest woman out of it?
That. Her. I mean, her.

821
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:11,979
- What are those things?
- Our children.

822
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:14,739
Best not look them in the eye.

823
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:17,419
Bring the best man
and the bridesmaid.

824
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:19,718
I looked it in the eye.

825
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:22,099
Place your hand on the Bible.

826
01:20:22,839 --> 01:20:24,939
- I have got scabies.
- So do I.

827
01:20:25,839 --> 01:20:28,099
Place your hand on the Bible.

828
01:20:28,589 --> 01:20:30,399
I'm a bed-wetter!

829
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:31,979
Say, I do.

830
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:36,198
- Or I'll put a bullet in your skull.
- Jack, they're going to kill us.

831
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:37,878
- I don't care!
- Just say, I do.

832
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:41,998
- Last chance, Jack.
- Wait. Surely, this is not legal.

833
01:20:41,999 --> 01:20:43,688
This is not legal.

834
01:20:43,689 --> 01:20:44,958
He's right.

835
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:47,659
Does any man here
object to these nuptials?

836
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:50,598
- I do.
- Congratulations.

837
01:20:50,599 --> 01:20:52,659
You may kiss the bride.

838
01:21:02,599 --> 01:21:04,459
Y-y-you...

839
01:21:04,599 --> 01:21:07,859
You like seafood, do you?

840
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,539
Jack, we meet again!

841
01:21:14,519 --> 01:21:15,739
Hector!

842
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:18,518
This is me bestest mate
in the whole world.

843
01:21:18,519 --> 01:21:21,318
I always knew you'd settle down,
eventually.

844
01:21:21,319 --> 01:21:22,779
Did you bring me a gift?

845
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:26,339
That'll do.

846
01:21:28,599 --> 01:21:32,259
You look marvelous.
Got quite a spring in your step.

847
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:34,659
Has your leg grown back?

848
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:37,139
Captain, shouldn't we be getting
back to Salazar.

849
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:39,779
Trade Mr. Sparrow's life in
for our own?

850
01:21:39,999 --> 01:21:44,139
Aye, that we could.
But I've come for the Trident of Poseidon.

851
01:21:44,999 --> 01:21:46,638
You're gonna double cross the dead?

852
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:47,859
You, did, promise.

853
01:21:47,959 --> 01:21:51,958
And with it I'll gut the dead
that stole my command of the sea.

854
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:54,139
As much as I love this plan.

855
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:57,998
No vessel can outrun that
wretched hull of a ship.

856
01:21:57,999 --> 01:21:59,638
But there be one, Jack.

857
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:01,118
The fastest ship I know.

858
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:06,819
The pearl, trapped in that bottle
by Blackbeard, 5 winters ago.

859
01:22:08,599 --> 01:22:11,739
By the power of that
blackguard's sovereign blade

860
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:17,339
I hereby release the Black Pearl,
to her former and rightful glory.

861
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:29,779
Get ready!

862
01:22:30,199 --> 01:22:31,779
Get ready!

863
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:35,099
It's coming.
It's coming! It's coming!

864
01:22:39,999 --> 01:22:42,999
Stand aside! Stand aside!

865
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:45,419
It's coming!

866
01:23:00,999 --> 01:23:02,779
It's shrunken.

867
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:05,099
Why doesn't it unshrink?

868
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:07,568
Maybe it's cold.

869
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:09,439
She needs the sea!

870
01:23:23,309 --> 01:23:25,259
She was a fine ship.

871
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,489
Let's...

872
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:06,219
There be room for only one captain.

873
01:24:08,349 --> 01:24:12,619
- Oo, filthy beast.
- Time to raise the dead.

874
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:23,339
The only safe place is the land.
Why are we going away from the land?

875
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:25,079
Does anybody know?

876
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:27,729
Captain, your map is incomplete.

877
01:24:27,909 --> 01:24:31,069
I can take us to the Trident,
if you'd only trust me.

878
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:33,929
Did you not hear anything I just said?

879
01:24:34,189 --> 01:24:38,009
So you be saying, that,
that star is pretending to be a map?

880
01:24:38,069 --> 01:24:42,468
Sir, there is no island on any map
to support what the woman says.

881
01:24:42,469 --> 01:24:44,409
Captain, you don't have
to understand her.

882
01:24:44,509 --> 01:24:46,049
Just believe her.

883
01:24:47,069 --> 01:24:48,609
Anyone?

884
01:25:00,589 --> 01:25:04,049
If we had something sharp,
I could pick that lock.

885
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,409
You're not gonna find
anything sharp in here.

886
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,809
Keep still you bilge rat!

887
01:25:18,909 --> 01:25:20,809
Please, I don't wanna
be captain anymore!

888
01:25:29,609 --> 01:25:31,079
Release them!

889
01:25:32,989 --> 01:25:37,428
Sir, you wouldn't allow a woman
to steer your ship?!

890
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:40,769
She will follow her star,
or we'll all die together.

891
01:26:00,269 --> 01:26:03,308
The Black Pearl!
She sails again!

892
01:26:03,309 --> 01:26:05,249
Yeah!

893
01:26:06,349 --> 01:26:09,089
This ship, those ghosts...

894
01:26:09,989 --> 01:26:11,828
there can be no logical explanation.

895
01:26:11,829 --> 01:26:13,969
The myths of the sea
are real, Carina.

896
01:26:14,189 --> 01:26:16,329
I'm glad you can finally
see you were wrong.

897
01:26:16,349 --> 01:26:17,849
Wrong?

898
01:26:19,309 --> 01:26:20,968
Perhaps I had some doubts.

899
01:26:20,969 --> 01:26:22,828
This is the worst apology
I've ever heard.

900
01:26:22,829 --> 01:26:24,668
Apology? Why would I apologize?

901
01:26:24,669 --> 01:26:26,908
Because we've been chased
by the dead, sailing on a ship,

902
01:26:26,909 --> 01:26:29,148
raised from a bottle.
Where is your science in that?

903
01:26:29,149 --> 01:26:31,689
Fine, I will apologize.

904
01:26:32,269 --> 01:26:33,129
Go on, then.

905
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:35,188
Well then, one could argue that
you owe me an apology.

906
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:37,988
As my life has been threatened by
pirates and dead men.

907
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:40,249
Which you now believe in,
sorry to say.

908
01:26:40,509 --> 01:26:42,049
Apology accepted.

909
01:26:43,869 --> 01:26:45,409
I'm going to the lookout.

910
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,729
I'm glad you see it my way.

911
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:55,489
12 degrees to port!

912
01:26:57,149 --> 01:26:59,908
- Ready the guns.
- Aye. Ready the guns!

913
01:26:59,909 --> 01:27:02,489
These pirates are going
for the Trident.

914
01:27:16,669 --> 01:27:18,889
Where did you get that from, Missy?

915
01:27:19,429 --> 01:27:23,628
I know this book, stolen from
an Italian ship, many years ago.

916
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:24,889
Stolen?

917
01:27:25,149 --> 01:27:26,468
No, you're mistaken.

918
01:27:26,469 --> 01:27:30,489
There was a Ruby on the cover,
I would not soon forget.

919
01:27:33,329 --> 01:27:35,588
This was given to me by my father.

920
01:27:35,589 --> 01:27:38,079
He was clearly a man of science.

921
01:27:39,709 --> 01:27:42,329
He was clearly a common thief.

922
01:27:43,229 --> 01:27:46,889
The memory of my father will not be
befouled by the tongue of a pirate!

923
01:27:47,469 --> 01:27:49,609
This diary is my birthright.

924
01:27:49,709 --> 01:27:51,969
Left to me on the steps
of a children's home.

925
01:27:52,429 --> 01:27:54,289
Along with a name and nothing else.

926
01:27:54,509 --> 01:27:56,369
Oh, so you're an orphan?

927
01:27:57,309 --> 01:27:58,849
What be you called?

928
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:03,249
The brightest star in the North
gave me my name.

929
01:28:09,949 --> 01:28:13,689
- That would be Carina.
- Carina Smyth.

930
01:28:15,069 --> 01:28:19,489
- So, you do know your stars?
- I'm a captain...

931
01:28:22,669 --> 01:28:25,869
I know which stars to follow home.

932
01:29:08,489 --> 01:29:10,509
Smyth?

933
01:29:10,909 --> 01:29:13,749
Smyth is quite an unusual name.

934
01:29:14,589 --> 01:29:18,128
Did we not, once, know someone
called Smyth?

935
01:29:18,129 --> 01:29:21,409
- Shut your trap!
- What was her name?

936
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:23,569
It's right on the tip of me tongue.

937
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:27,379
- Do you wanna lose that tongue?
- Margaret Smyth!

938
01:29:28,269 --> 01:29:30,789
Aye, so we make an accord then?

939
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:35,948
Or, shall I tell you know who,
what we both know is the truth.

940
01:29:35,949 --> 01:29:39,468
- We both take this secret to our graves.
- You mean, it is true?

941
01:29:39,469 --> 01:29:41,228
- I was bluffing.
- I'm not!

942
01:29:41,229 --> 01:29:44,649
You kill me, you got nothing
to bargain the dead with.

943
01:29:44,989 --> 01:29:47,079
So you need me.

944
01:29:47,869 --> 01:29:52,668
I'll have to frank Hector.
You are very, very, ugly,

945
01:29:52,669 --> 01:29:57,089
so how could you produce
a fetching creature, such as that?

946
01:29:57,389 --> 01:29:58,969
Margaret died.

947
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:02,449
I summoned as much honor as a
worthless blackguard ever could.

948
01:30:02,549 --> 01:30:06,388
I placed the infant in an orphanage,
never to see her again.

949
01:30:06,389 --> 01:30:09,388
I thought the ruby might afford her
some ease in life.

950
01:30:09,389 --> 01:30:11,969
But I never imagined
she'd take those scribblings

951
01:30:12,109 --> 01:30:14,079
and make a life of her own.

952
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:17,209
A life that's led her back to me.

953
01:30:19,869 --> 01:30:24,988
I'd say this puts me in a
rather favorable position, Daddy.

954
01:30:24,989 --> 01:30:27,569
- Tell me what you want.
- I want me compass.

955
01:30:28,349 --> 01:30:34,009
216 barrels of rum.
And the monkey.

956
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,508
- You want Jack?
- Dinner!

957
01:30:36,509 --> 01:30:38,529
I want to eat him.
I want to eat that monk...

958
01:30:39,069 --> 01:30:41,948
No deal Jack.
A clever young woman such as that,

959
01:30:41,949 --> 01:30:46,369
would never believe that a swine
like me could ever be her blood.

960
01:30:49,229 --> 01:30:51,649
And the Trident will be mine.

961
01:31:02,269 --> 01:31:03,829
Redcoats!

962
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:06,449
Redcoats!

963
01:31:09,069 --> 01:31:13,009
- Prepare to fire!
- Prepare to fire!

964
01:31:19,909 --> 01:31:22,249
She comes starboard!

965
01:31:22,749 --> 01:31:24,818
We shall fight to the last.

966
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:28,129
The Pearl will not be
taken from me again!

967
01:31:32,829 --> 01:31:34,449
Sir.

968
01:31:38,829 --> 01:31:42,489
Only the British Empire
will hold the power of the sea.

969
01:32:16,669 --> 01:32:20,009
What ever happens,
stay your course.

970
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:50,428
Jack Sparrow? Jack Sparrow?

971
01:32:50,429 --> 01:32:52,809
I've come with the butcher's bill.

972
01:32:57,149 --> 01:32:58,689
Where is he?

973
01:33:01,549 --> 01:33:05,889
Defend yourselves, men, to the death!

974
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:11,449
Hurry up man!
What, did you sharpen it with butter?

975
01:33:32,169 --> 01:33:34,379
There's nowhere to hide.

976
01:33:49,389 --> 01:33:52,249
Let's be brave, save the Pearl!

977
01:34:01,429 --> 01:34:03,079
This has to be it.

978
01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:07,018
It has to be here.

979
01:34:07,019 --> 01:34:10,609
Find that land, or we'll all die!

980
01:34:10,749 --> 01:34:12,369
We're nearly there.

981
01:34:12,669 --> 01:34:14,729
It's here, somewhere.

982
01:35:35,779 --> 01:35:37,870
Have you found what
you're looking for yet, miss?

983
01:35:37,871 --> 01:35:39,726
I'm trying!

984
01:35:43,499 --> 01:35:45,769
The stars will soon be gone.

985
01:36:15,219 --> 01:36:16,658
Carina!

986
01:36:16,659 --> 01:36:20,299
Henry, look, the island is there!

987
01:36:20,499 --> 01:36:22,259
You found it!

988
01:36:32,389 --> 01:36:34,079
The island.

989
01:36:39,459 --> 01:36:41,079
Land!

990
01:36:41,939 --> 01:36:43,839
Get to the Mary!

991
01:36:59,619 --> 01:37:00,999
Carina!

992
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:18,559
Carina!

993
01:37:21,499 --> 01:37:22,959
Henry!

994
01:37:36,119 --> 01:37:37,578
They took Henry!

995
01:37:37,579 --> 01:37:40,258
The Trident be all that can
save him, now.

996
01:37:40,259 --> 01:37:42,079
Then we have to find it.

997
01:38:01,619 --> 01:38:03,339
Where is it?

998
01:38:07,619 --> 01:38:09,419
It has to be here.

999
01:38:41,059 --> 01:38:42,779
Look at it Jack.

1000
01:38:43,299 --> 01:38:45,719
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1001
01:38:45,939 --> 01:38:48,298
This is what my father
wanted me to find.

1002
01:38:48,299 --> 01:38:52,479
- Rocks?
- No, not rocks, stars.

1003
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:55,519
This is the map no man can read.

1004
01:38:56,419 --> 01:39:00,559
This island is a perfect reflection
of the heavens.

1005
01:39:07,939 --> 01:39:11,079
One star's missing.
Quickly!

1006
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:14,039
We have to find the
Trident to save Henry.

1007
01:39:14,179 --> 01:39:17,799
Hector, I think you should know
she's a horologist.

1008
01:39:45,289 --> 01:39:47,079
Why isn't it glowing?

1009
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:50,339
Finish it, Carina.

1010
01:39:56,399 --> 01:39:58,039
The missing star.

1011
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:01,299
For my father.

1012
01:40:02,379 --> 01:40:06,119
Aye, do it for him.

1013
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,619
There.

1014
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:40,989
Poseidon's tomb!

1015
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:42,699
This way.

1016
01:41:45,579 --> 01:41:48,399
<i>Capitán</i>, you know the danger.
Don't do it!

1017
01:41:48,499 --> 01:41:51,418
He has no choice.
Jack is on land going for the Trident.

1018
01:41:51,419 --> 01:41:53,058
<i>Capitán</i>, there must be another way.

1019
01:41:53,059 --> 01:41:55,378
Once you possess the living,
there's no coming back.

1020
01:41:55,379 --> 01:41:58,098
You will be trapped in his body, forever.

1021
01:41:58,099 --> 01:41:59,959
The Trident will set me free.

1022
01:42:02,899 --> 01:42:06,079
- Time to kill a sparrow.
- No!

1023
01:42:19,619 --> 01:42:23,079
- Look Jack, there it is.
- The Trident!

1024
01:42:29,299 --> 01:42:31,039
Jack!

1025
01:43:08,779 --> 01:43:11,819
You cut me, you cut the boy, Jack.

1026
01:43:46,979 --> 01:43:48,999
- Henry!
- No.

1027
01:44:20,539 --> 01:44:22,959
<i>Hola,</i> Sparrow?

1028
01:44:23,779 --> 01:44:25,379
No.

1029
01:44:36,499 --> 01:44:39,659
I hate the Sparrow. Die Sparrow.

1030
01:44:40,539 --> 01:44:42,719
No!

1031
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:50,098
Henry, he's walking on land!

1032
01:44:50,099 --> 01:44:51,599
Please! Henry wake up!

1033
01:44:53,619 --> 01:44:55,119
Oh, piss off!

1034
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,079
Henry wake up, he's killing Jack!

1035
01:45:17,459 --> 01:45:18,859
Henry!

1036
01:45:19,219 --> 01:45:21,119
- Power of the sea.
- What?

1037
01:45:21,699 --> 01:45:23,318
The power of the sea.

1038
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:27,079
"To release the power of the sea
all must divide".

1039
01:45:32,989 --> 01:45:35,488
If the Trident holds
all the power, then...

1040
01:45:35,489 --> 01:45:37,599
Then every curse is held inside.

1041
01:45:38,099 --> 01:45:40,258
As I told you before,

1042
01:45:40,259 --> 01:45:43,619
surrender to me now
and I will let you...

1043
01:45:44,179 --> 01:45:45,548
...live.

1044
01:45:45,549 --> 01:45:50,528
- Do you want me to surrender?
- Maybe.

1045
01:45:50,529 --> 01:45:52,719
This is where the tale ends!

1046
01:45:55,019 --> 01:45:56,239
No!

1047
01:46:02,019 --> 01:46:03,939
Die!

1048
01:46:09,019 --> 01:46:10,498
Divide.

1049
01:46:10,499 --> 01:46:12,079
Henry!

1050
01:46:13,859 --> 01:46:15,738
Divide. Break.

1051
01:46:15,739 --> 01:46:18,338
Break the Trident and you'll
break every curse of the sea.

1052
01:46:18,339 --> 01:46:20,679
<i>Adios,</i> Sparrow.

1053
01:47:06,249 --> 01:47:08,079
All curses have broken.

1054
01:47:16,489 --> 01:47:18,088
Yeah!

1055
01:47:28,489 --> 01:47:30,488
We're flesh and blood!

1056
01:47:47,729 --> 01:47:51,528
- The Pearl! My Pearl!
- Climb.

1057
01:47:51,529 --> 01:47:53,919
Move, fast!

1058
01:47:57,289 --> 01:48:00,709
Hold it steady boys,
don't let it slip.

1059
01:48:05,209 --> 01:48:07,079
Jack!

1060
01:48:09,609 --> 01:48:11,189
Faster!

1061
01:48:23,409 --> 01:48:26,288
Hoist, anchor!

1062
01:48:26,289 --> 01:48:28,368
Get the anchor up, quick!

1063
01:48:28,369 --> 01:48:31,669
Stop, stop.
Bring it up, bring it up!

1064
01:48:49,009 --> 01:48:52,029
<i>Capitán, Capitán</i>!

1065
01:49:17,169 --> 01:49:19,079
Oh, crap!

1066
01:49:40,009 --> 01:49:41,989
I've got ya.

1067
01:50:03,329 --> 01:50:05,569
Who am I to you?

1068
01:50:07,849 --> 01:50:09,709
Treasure.

1069
01:50:20,089 --> 01:50:21,669
Hold on!

1070
01:50:24,969 --> 01:50:26,529
Hector!

1071
01:51:41,449 --> 01:51:43,189
Go to starboard!

1072
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:11,249
Pirate's life, Hector...

1073
01:52:47,129 --> 01:52:48,669
You were right.

1074
01:52:49,849 --> 01:52:51,429
I don't know.

1075
01:52:51,569 --> 01:52:54,309
For a moment I had everything, Henry.

1076
01:52:55,989 --> 01:52:57,928
Now, it's all gone, again.

1077
01:52:57,929 --> 01:53:00,589
It's not all gone, Miss Smyth.

1078
01:53:13,849 --> 01:53:18,469
Barbossa. My name is Barbossa.

1079
01:54:00,329 --> 01:54:03,629
- Maybe Jack was right.
- About what?

1080
01:54:04,089 --> 01:54:06,088
The unscratchable itch.

1081
01:54:09,389 --> 01:54:10,968
Why did you do that for?

1082
01:54:10,969 --> 01:54:12,829
Just checking it's truly you.

1083
01:54:12,969 --> 01:54:14,709
You're not still cursed.

1084
01:54:15,529 --> 01:54:17,978
- It's me.
- Then I was...

1085
01:54:17,979 --> 01:54:20,469
- Wrong!
- Slightly in error.

1086
01:54:20,809 --> 01:54:22,429
Although, one...

1087
01:54:28,489 --> 01:54:30,469
Apology accepted.

1088
01:54:43,609 --> 01:54:45,389
The Dutchman.

1089
01:55:20,489 --> 01:55:23,749
- Henry.
- Yes, father.

1090
01:55:32,489 --> 01:55:34,749
Let me look at you son.

1091
01:55:38,889 --> 01:55:40,709
How did you do it?

1092
01:55:42,249 --> 01:55:45,569
- How did you break the curse?
- Let me tell you a tale.

1093
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:48,248
A tale of the greatest
treasure known to man.

1094
01:55:48,249 --> 01:55:58,429
That's a tale I wanna hear.

1095
01:56:48,689 --> 01:56:50,958
What a truly revolting sight!

1096
01:56:50,959 --> 01:56:52,248
Make way!

1097
01:56:52,249 --> 01:56:54,808
Captain Jack Sparrow on deck.♥

1098
01:56:54,809 --> 01:56:56,409
Indeed!

1099
01:57:00,769 --> 01:57:02,468
Welcome back, Captain.

1100
01:57:02,469 --> 01:57:04,688
I thank you very much.
Coming through.

1101
01:57:04,689 --> 01:57:07,429
- Captain!
- Thank you, I remember you.

1102
01:57:07,849 --> 01:57:09,929
- Cheers, thank you.
- Oh good!

1103
01:57:10,029 --> 01:57:12,928
- Master Gibbs.
- The ship is yours Captain.

1104
01:57:12,929 --> 01:57:14,529
I thank you!

1105
01:57:25,989 --> 01:57:27,489
Monkey.

1106
01:57:34,329 --> 01:57:36,049
Thank you.

1107
01:57:36,569 --> 01:57:38,768
What be our headin' Cap'n?

1108
01:57:38,769 --> 01:57:42,029
We should follow the stars,
