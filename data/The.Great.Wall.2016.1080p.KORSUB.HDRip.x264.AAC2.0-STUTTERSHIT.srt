The Great Wall has stood for centuries

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,406
as one of mankind's
most enduring wonders.

4
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,046
It spans over 5500 miles

5
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,675
and took more than 1700 years to build.

6
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,851
It protected from many dangers.
Some are known. Some are legend.

7
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,981
This is one of the legends.

THE GREAT WALL

Subtitle by Bambula

10
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,217
All Commanders to the Great Hall!
All Commanders report to the General!

11
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,679
Make way! Make way!

12
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,897
All Commanders to the Great Hall!
Make way!

13
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,194
Commander Lin is needed immediately!
Calling Commander Lin!

14
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,531
Commander Lin is needed immediately!

15
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,298
He says two days ride
north, in the mountains.

16
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,385
They claim to have killed it.
-Two days?

17
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,847
Earlier than we expected.
Strategist Wang.

18
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:02,269
I'm listening, General.
-The two of them killed it?

19
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,409
He claims to have killed it alone.
-By himself? -Impossible.

20
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,679
Guards!

21
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,281
Commander Lin. Wait.

22
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,504
General. They claim to be
traders who were ambushed.

23
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,843
These barbarians are liars.
-Perhaps not.

24
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:20,556
They brought the claw here.
The wound is fresh.

25
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:25,102
There is green blood on his sword.
Those prove his story.

26
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,526
To protect our secret,
we must kill them.

27
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:35,571
Eliminate the possibility of trouble.
-I agree.

28
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,322
We should kill them!

29
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,787
General, until we find the truth,

30
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,708
I advise we keep them alive.
-Alert!

31
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,089
General, signals from the smoke towers!
We are under attack!

32
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,258
Take them to stockade.

33
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,846
All stations on full alert!
-All stations on full alert!

34
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,417
What's happening here, amigo?
Is this bitch going to kill us?

35
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:20,384
Hurry! -I'm sorry, sir.
I cannot find the key.

36
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:24,054
Forget it. Bring them to the Wall.
Keep an eye on them!

37
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:37,317
General. It's finally happening.
-Yes.

38
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,320
Sixty years preparing for this moment.

39
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,336
Stop! Stop!

40
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:00,716
Go! Go!

41
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,802
Inside!

42
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,008
Stand still!

43
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,077
Get down! Get down!

44
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,468
Catch it!

45
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,272
Long distance weapons!
-Yes!

46
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,810
Drums signal long distance weapons!

47
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,865
Grab it!

48
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,662
Light it!

49
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:37,159
Aim for the eyes! Aim for the eyes!

50
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,805
Crane Corps attack!

51
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,401
General, there is the Queen!
She commands them!

52
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,403
Attack the Queen!

53
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,692
Close combat!
-Yes! Close combat!

54
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,736
Drums signal close combat!

55
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,453
You fought well today.

56
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:49,383
Take them to the barracks.
They need rest. -Yes.

57
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,580
Thank you for saving my life.

58
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,025
Commandeer Lin. You grew
up in the Nameless Order.

59
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,069
I've taught you many things...

60
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:56,533
And you have been learning,

61
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,078
but they have been learning also.
Strategist Wang warned they are evolving.

62
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,748
No one listened.

63
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,091
The enemies we're facing today

64
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,629
are more intelligent
than sixty years ago.

65
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,363
Watch the foreigners closely.
They can never leave.

66
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:17,304
We must protect the secrets of the Wall.
-Yes, sir!

67
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,456
General.

68
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:53,126
I couldn't help wondering,

69
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:57,631
why would such an accomplished archer,
use such a primitive bow.

70
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:10,185
He claims his weapon
is second to none.

71
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,776
Let him show us.
Give him some space!

72
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:31,957
Unless he is afraid.
It's a large audience.

73
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,277
Men are too heavy.
Do you think we can pull him up?

74
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,762
Trust.

75
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:38,555
Xin ren.

76
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,704
Stay vigilant!
The next attack is coming.

77
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,022
Strategist Wang requests your presence.

78
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:29,328
Troops unaccounted
for at the West Tower!

79
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:49,014
Why did they leave the bodies?

80
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,351
Dismount!

81
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,937
Formation!

82
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,842
Advance!

83
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:26,278
Stop!

84
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,829
Commander Lin.

85
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:38,832
General...

86
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,169
They led us into a trap.

87
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:45,088
We underestimated their intelligence.

88
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:01,230
The Nameless Order

89
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:06,193
is yours to command.
-General...

90
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:09,530
Commanders, this is my final order.

91
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,535
From this day forward,

92
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:20,332
Commander Lin will lead you.

93
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:25,796
The soldiers of Nameless Order
will stand firm.

94
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:29,550
The Wall must not fall!
We will defeat the Tao Tei!

95
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:33,595
Rest in peace!
-Rest in peace!

96
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:25,707
This is 900-year-old battle report.
-A 900-year-old battle report.

97
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:14,464
How to prove it?

98
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:25,392
He wants to try.
He wants to catch one.

99
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:46,413
Use a spear, hook them.
So we can catch them.

100
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,836
He claims to have seen it done it Spain.

101
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:23,033
The mixture must be strong
to put the creatures to sleep.

102
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:31,333
Spread it on evenly.
-Yes, Commander.

103
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,704
Snap out of it!

104
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:29,600
Useless idiot! Report to the kitchen
where you belong! -Yes, Commander!

105
00:47:29,635 --> 00:47:31,310
Go!

106
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:10,993
Death Squad ready!
-Yes! Death Squad go!

107
00:49:14,163 --> 00:49:16,957
Blades ready!

108
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:27,634
Blades forward!
-Attack! -Go!

109
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:36,185
Left! Right!

110
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:31,448
Harpoons! -Harpoons, now!
-Yes! Harpoons, fire!

111
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:36,453
Fire!

112
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,371
There! -Move!
-It's the last one!

113
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,941
Pull!

114
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,737
Hold!

115
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:55,032
Let him run!

116
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:16,261
Ring of fire!
-Yes! Ring of fire!

117
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,668
Screaming arrows!
-Yes! Screaming arrows!

118
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:10,899
Aim inside the circle.
Blanket the whole area.

119
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:16,780
Fire!

120
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:58,155
Pull!

121
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,995
Prepare black powder weapons!
-Prepare black powder weapons!

122
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:35,759
Prepare to light the fuses!

123
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,963
Yes! Prepare to light the fuses!

124
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:30,033
Xin ren.

125
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:22,020
Excellent. Send it to the
capital immediately. -No!

126
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:26,733
We need to study it here. -If Tao Tei is
captured alive, it must be sent to the Emperor.

127
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:29,194
This is Imperial Order.

128
01:01:57,217 --> 01:02:00,394
Tao Tei movement!

129
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:04,183
All troops to the Wall!

130
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:51,832
General, it goes all the way through.
Tao Tei have breached the Wall.

131
01:03:51,867 --> 01:03:54,001
They're smarter than we thought.

132
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:57,880
Summon my commanders immediately!
-Yes, General.

133
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:24,199
All of the attacks have been a diversion,
while they dug this tunnel.

134
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:31,241
They have breached the Wall. Once they reach
the capital, nothing in the world can stop them.

135
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:35,961
At a full gallop,
it's 2 days to the capital.

136
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:40,167
There is no way we can catch them.
-The wind is strong now.

137
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:45,631
It blows from the north all day
tomorrow. We have to use the balloons.

138
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:49,635
If it works, how long to Bianliang?
-Six hours if the wind holds.

139
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:51,428
If we make it alive.

140
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:55,432
General, none of the tests have worked.

141
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,519
Get ready!

142
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:25,087
THE CAPITAL
BIANLIANG

143
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:02,624
How did you capture it?
-Your Excellency.

144
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:07,588
It's the magnet!
It keeps the beast under the control.

145
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:12,509
This is the most important discovery
in the history of the Tao Tei.

146
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:17,598
We will investigate immediately.
-Bring him here!

147
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,178
Liar!

148
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:11,235
General.

149
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:18,242
General.
-Speak up!

150
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:24,331
I was there when it happened.
I saw him try to stop them.

151
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:34,466
Are you sure?

152
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:39,638
If you're lying, I'll have your head!

153
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:43,433
I swear on my vow to the Nameless Order!

154
01:09:57,197 --> 01:10:01,577
Lock him up. Send the cavalry. Go after
the two that got away. -Yes, General.

155
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:36,839
Keep it steady! -Yes, General.
-Watch the powder! -Yes, General!

156
01:13:28,325 --> 01:13:33,121
Strategist Wang!
Please take me with you.

157
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:03,277
Distance is the key. The magnet is
only effective when close to the beast.

158
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:08,365
Therefore, the effect weakens
as it gets further away.

159
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:10,742
You see I have it
under complete control.

160
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:16,331
Write down nine feet.

161
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:08,193
Steer to the rear of the palace.
-Yes. To the rear of the palace!

162
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:20,390
Light a grenade!
-Yes, sir!

163
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:11,191
State your purpose!

164
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,972
General Lin Mae of the Nameless Order.
At your service!

165
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,610
What took you so long?

166
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:44,237
The Tao Tei have overrun the city!

167
01:18:44,404 --> 01:18:47,080
Thousands of soldiers and
innocents are dead. You're too late!

168
01:18:47,138 --> 01:18:49,282
Your Majesty, where is
the captured Tao Tei?

169
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:52,205
In the dungeon!
-We need to kill the Queen.

170
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:55,689
Once she is dead,
the Tao Tei cannot function.

171
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:58,608
Without her signal, their
whole army will freeze.

172
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,374
Trust.

173
01:26:12,305 --> 01:26:18,721
