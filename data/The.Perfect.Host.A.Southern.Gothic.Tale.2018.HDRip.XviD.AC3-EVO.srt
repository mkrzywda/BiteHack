00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:01,899
Oh, good evening, dear.

3
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:05,903
I'm sorry. I...

4
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:12,242
...I just wanted to stop by and have
a more private moment with her.

5
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:16,580
Well, forgive me, dear.

6
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,960
I'll go.
I'll just go now.

7
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,506
Where'd you get that?

8
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:27,758
Hmm?

9
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:31,804
Your necklace, where did you get that?

10
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,558
It was my mothers and
her mother's before that.

11
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,896
Mamaw had one just like it.

12
00:02:41,772 --> 00:02:44,149
Yes, I gave it to her.

13
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:46,777
It's to protect you.

14
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:54,326
Women in my family seem to
believe that sort of thing.

15
00:02:56,912 --> 00:03:00,666
Alma believed most of it...too.

16
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,135
Alma was like my blood.

17
00:03:14,763 --> 00:03:18,684
Well, if there's anything now that I
can help you with...

18
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:23,897
...if you need a place to stay or to rest,
here. Don't hesitate.

19
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,572
Thanks.

20
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,866
I wish you the best.

21
00:04:01,894 --> 00:04:04,229
Did you get Mamaw's power turned back on?

22
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:06,857
No.

23
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:10,110
Come on, Julie.

24
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,532
Get over there,
and go through her things...

25
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:18,702
...or leave.

26
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,711
I want you out of my house, now.

27
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:37,054
A few more nights is all I need,
and you will never see me again - ever.

28
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,183
No.

29
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:45,062
I'm your fucking blood.

30
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:52,361
It's never mattered before.
Ain't gonna start now.

31
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:56,740
You can have Mamaw's house, Kristy.

32
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,870
I don't want the house, Julie.

33
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:04,665
I don't need the house.

34
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,320
Hello?

35
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,201
Hello?

36
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:43,717
I am so, so sorry.
I think we've come to the wrong place...

37
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,844
I want you out of my house, right now.

38
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:50,223
Julie?

39
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:52,684
Mrs. Frances...

40
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:54,476
...I'm sorry I stepped in...

41
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:55,602
You know her?

42
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:58,855
This is Alma's granddaughter, Julie,
and her daughter...

43
00:08:58,857 --> 00:08:59,858
Ellie.

44
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,109
Ellie.

45
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:03,987
They're going to be our guests for a few days.

46
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:07,574
I guess it slipped my mind to tell you.

47
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:10,450
Can I have a word with you?

48
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:13,872
...I'm very glad you're here,
both of you.

49
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:15,957
This way.

50
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:21,963
I really feel like I'm intruding on you.

51
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:24,464
If your husband doesn't want us to stay,
you know...

52
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:27,967
Listen, Julie.
I'm in charge in this house.

53
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,680
What he thinks or wants
is of no matter.

54
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:34,476
I want you here, both of you.
And that's that.

55
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:39,147
It's such a big house.

56
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,440
Too big.

57
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:44,694
It's really easy to get lonely inside those walls.

58
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:47,239
Too many things...

59
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:50,283
...lots of history inside there.

60
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:01,461
Go ahead.

61
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:06,216
In the hall, we have some extra rooms, but...

62
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:10,262
...this one, this one is the nicest one.

63
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:17,060
I don't know how to thank you enough
for helping us out - letting us intrude.

64
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:23,898
Ellie...

65
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,318
...get down from there.

66
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:29,489
Here's the key.

67
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:35,453
We don't lock these rooms up here,
but we want to respect your privacy...

68
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:38,665
...so please lock yourselves in.

69
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,795
Now, ugh, the bathroom is down the way
on this side of the hall.

70
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,840
Let me take your jacket downstairs...

71
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:50,010
...and I'll hang it up down there.

72
00:10:58,393 --> 00:10:59,269
I forgot.

73
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:02,939
Yeah, there.

74
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:04,941
What's that?

75
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,068
It's for protection.

76
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:10,403
Do we need protection?

77
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:12,616
Oh, everybody needs protection, dear...

78
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:15,202
...whether it's Saint Christopher or...

79
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:18,121
...The Devil's Shoestring.

80
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:20,248
Goodnight.

81
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:21,458
Goodbye.

82
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:29,507
Mrs. Frances is weird.

83
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:39,577
Momma?

84
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:59,741
I think...I think there might
be a window open in there.

85
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:38,405
Ellie, are you asleep?

86
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:42,158
Ellie, are you asleep?

87
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,035
Ellie?

88
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:11,561
♪ Rock-a-bye baby in the tree top
when the wind blows the cradle will rock. ♪

89
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:15,064
♪ When the bow breaks, the cradle will fall. ♪

90
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:18,945
♪ And down will come baby, cradle and all. ♪

91
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:21,990
Morning.

92
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:24,159
What are you two doing?

93
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:26,909
Oh, just playing.

94
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:29,372
Look what Mrs. Frances let me have.

95
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,042
That's nice, Ellie.

96
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,420
Sit, please.

97
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:39,048
Did you rest well last night?

98
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:41,257
Yeah.

99
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,091
Oh, good.

100
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:44,971
Do you want juice, coffee, or milk?

101
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:46,890
Coffee, please.

102
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:49,809
You stay away from that old man, okay.

103
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:50,725
Why?

104
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:52,145
Because I told you to.

105
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:55,273
Here.

106
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:57,942
What about you, darling?
Did you rest well?

107
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,948
Answer her, Ellie.

108
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,200
Yes.

109
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:06,868
Good.

110
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,001
Why are you being weird?

111
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:22,383
Be nice to her, okay?
She's being nice to us.

112
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:30,183
Mrs. Frances?

113
00:16:30,683 --> 00:16:31,643
Yes?

114
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:33,603
The room upstairs...

115
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:36,648
...the one at the end of the hall...

116
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:39,442
Was there a problem?

117
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:41,236
No...

118
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:47,406
...there was a draft coming from the inside....

119
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:49,494
...maybe a cracked window or something.

120
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:55,583
We lost the key to that room years ago.

121
00:16:57,418 --> 00:17:00,296
We seldom use the second floor.

122
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:04,050
Bad knees and what not...

123
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:08,638
I just thought it might
help with the heating.

124
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:12,642
I'm sorry.
I'm being nosy.

125
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,737
It was in the summer, mostly.

126
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:29,993
Her mother would come by to clean,
and she'd bring Alma.

127
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:35,331
We always had such a big time.

128
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:40,878
You wouldn't believe
the things we've been through.

129
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:46,009
Ellie looks so much like her.

130
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:50,805
Ellie?

131
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:57,186
Stay in there, okay? Don't touch anything.

132
00:18:15,455 --> 00:18:17,081
Ellie?

133
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:43,149
Hello?

134
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:36,828
Ellie?

135
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:37,995
Shh...

136
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,331
Don't shush me.

137
00:19:40,957 --> 00:19:43,126
I don't want you running around this house.

138
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:09,277
Julie?

139
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:14,490
Since you're going to Alma's,
would you like me to watch over Ellie?

140
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:17,869
It's really no problem.

141
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,621
You go do what you need to.

142
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,584
I've watched over children all my life...

143
00:20:26,586 --> 00:20:30,381
...and Harold's going to town soon,
so it'll just be her and me.

144
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,554
Would you rather stay and play?

145
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:40,016
I don't care.

146
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,269
I have some dolls.

147
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:45,229
We'll have a BIG time!

148
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:51,442
Remember what I told you earlier, okay?

149
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:52,445
Okay.

150
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:55,364
She'll be in safe hands.

151
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,868
Come on, little one!

152
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:17,570
Hello?

153
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:18,737
Hey Jonathan?

154
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,074
Hey!

155
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,323
Hello?

156
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:23,619
This ain't me,
but you can leave me a message.

157
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,042
Hey Jonathan, it's Julie.

158
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:36,215
I'm in town for Mamaw's funeral,
and I'll be around for a few days.

159
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:38,674
And I was wondering if...

160
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:41,218
If you're...

161
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,514
...if you're around, and...

162
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,436
...it would be nice to see you, considering...

163
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:50,146
...okay.

164
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:51,689
Bye.

165
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:07,705
Ronnie.

166
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,083
Ronnie, get your stuff.

167
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,586
What's wrong?
What's the matter?

168
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:17,004
Ain't nothing the matter.

169
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:20,259
I got things to do, and your car is blocking me in.

170
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:23,636
Here...

171
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:25,348
...take that.

172
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:28,351
I'm not your fucking hooker.

173
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:30,978
Okay, fine.

174
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:32,519
I'll move your fucking car.

175
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:38,194
But you'd better get your shit,
and not be here when I get back.

176
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:40,543
Jesus.

177
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,378
Pretty close.

178
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:50,052
How are you?

179
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:57,560
I'm fine.

180
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:02,523
I didn't know I'd see you.

181
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:04,608
You been okay?

182
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,820
Yeah, I'm okay.

183
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:13,868
You look good.

184
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:20,416
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to her funeral yesterday.

185
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,127
I just...
I didn't want to...

186
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:35,055
You want to go somewhere?

187
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:36,307
Like out...

188
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:39,268
...away from here.

189
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:46,231
I thought I wanted to do this now, but...

190
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,484
Sure, yeah.

191
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:50,487
Think I know a good place.

192
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:14,386
What is this dump?

193
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:16,764
You think this is a dump?

194
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:19,308
What, do you work here?

195
00:28:19,642 --> 00:28:22,436
And to think, my Momma said I'd never
make anything of myself.

196
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,480
You own this place?

197
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:29,068
Welcome to my legacy, Julie.

198
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,945
Ladies first.

199
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:40,621
I can't believe you don't think
I could own my own place.

200
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:43,207
Do you blame me?

201
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,417
Really?

202
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:52,800
So, what do you think?

203
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:56,387
It's fine.

204
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:02,518
Kinda all the shitty, trashy things from here...

205
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:06,397
...balled up into one hole in the wall.

206
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:09,149
Please.

207
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:13,112
You want another one?

208
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:48,981
It's kinda weird seeing you here...

209
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:50,772
...Twilight Zone...

210
00:29:53,944 --> 00:29:55,446
...drinking...

211
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:58,407
...smoking...

212
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:03,370
...doing all the things you used to hate me for.

213
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:06,081
Hard times.

214
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,251
Yeah.

215
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:21,472
Since you got your mamaw's house,
you thinking about staying around a little bit?

216
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:23,974
You thinking about leaving?

217
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:28,062
Kinda waiting to see what this girl does.

218
00:30:31,357 --> 00:30:33,025
What about your kid?

219
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:35,361
How's he?

220
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:43,952
He's a she.
And I didn't think you knew about her.

221
00:30:51,377 --> 00:30:52,793
Is she mine?

222
00:30:52,795 --> 00:30:54,463
Would it make a difference?

223
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:07,226
She's not.

224
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:12,272
I'd still love to meet her.

225
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:15,734
I'm not bringing her around you.

226
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:24,159
Hey boy...

227
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:27,079
...you open?

228
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,709
Go home, Charlie. You know it's Sunday.

229
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:36,630
I thought you might feel like
selling a thirsty man a drink.

230
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,466
I ain't going to jail, Charlie.

231
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:40,843
Hell, boy.

232
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,761
I got cash.

233
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,847
Well, you can come back tomorrow.

234
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,227
You an asshole.

235
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:58,442
Your drinking buddy?

236
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:01,319
Look, we better get out of here before he comes back
begging for another drink.

237
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:02,781
But you just told him not to come...

238
00:32:03,282 --> 00:32:04,283
He'll forget.

239
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,160
C'mon.

240
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:12,374
Watch your step.

241
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,845
What are those?

242
00:32:25,596 --> 00:32:27,764
Those are snares, darling...

243
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:34,438
...a trap of sorts.

244
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,566
It catches things.

245
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:43,405
When I was a little girl,
your grandma and I used to play with those dollies there.

246
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,448
And then...

247
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:47,367
...my little girl did too.

248
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:55,167
Let's let this be our little secret...

249
00:32:55,918 --> 00:32:58,084
...yoru secret hideout.

250
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:00,839
Hi, Frances.

251
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,221
Why don't you play here...

252
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:08,931
...while I show the father around.

253
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:10,724
How does that sound?

254
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:12,976
Good.

255
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,017
Amen.

256
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:05,737
One of Mamaw's friends invited us to
stay with them.

257
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:10,659
You make it a point to shack up with strangers?

258
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,744
Do you?

259
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,746
Always.

260
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:21,668
So where does this friend live?

261
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,047
Why, you keeping tabs on me?

262
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:26,717
Maybe I am.

263
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:31,096
It's this huge, fucking house...

264
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,807
...in the middle of town.

265
00:34:34,224 --> 00:34:35,392
You oughta see it.

266
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:37,769
You're staying in The Allen House?

267
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:39,229
Yeah.

268
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:42,482
Jesus Christ, Julie.

269
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:43,815
What?

270
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,319
That place is haunted.

271
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:49,531
You're just trying to get me to
come over to your place.

272
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,907
I'm not.

273
00:34:51,408 --> 00:34:52,993
I swear I ain't lying.

274
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,996
People have died there.
That's a fact.

275
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:01,335
Fine.

276
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:03,420
Don't believe me.

277
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:07,758
At least it's better than you staying at some dump.

278
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:10,052
Like your place?

279
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:13,722
Yes, like my place.

280
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:31,990
Thanks for the booze and the talk.

281
00:35:36,453 --> 00:35:37,454
Anytime.

282
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:42,999
And seriously...

283
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:45,170
...I want to meet your daughter.

284
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:46,546
So just...

285
00:35:46,588 --> 00:35:48,048
Alright...

286
00:35:48,465 --> 00:35:51,134
...alright, I'll bring her by before we leave.

287
00:36:10,779 --> 00:36:11,613
Bye.

288
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:13,115
Bye.

289
00:36:53,363 --> 00:36:55,031
Welcome back.

290
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,454
Glad you made it before the storm began.

291
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:02,370
Yeah, it looks...

292
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:03,707
...bad out there.

293
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:08,587
Did you find anything?

294
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,297
Just some old photographs...

295
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,050
...things of that nature.

296
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:16,178
Nothing worth much, you know...

297
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:17,888
...where's Ellie?

298
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,894
Ellie and I just made supper.

299
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:26,772
Wow, you made supper?

300
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,735
Harold and I would like you to join us, if you'd like.

301
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:36,156
Did you have a good day today?
Did you have a good time?

302
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:40,410
I got to, um, play with some dolls
in Mrs. Frances'...

303
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:45,457
It's okay.

304
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,459
FRANCES?

305
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:56,925
Here...

306
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:58,512
...take this.

307
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:01,846
What about you?

308
00:38:01,848 --> 00:38:03,515
I know this house inside and out, I...

309
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:06,351
Mom, I don't want to be
down here anymore.

310
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:08,730
Oh darling, don't be afraid.

311
00:38:08,814 --> 00:38:10,440
It's just a storm.

312
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:12,943
Tell you what...

313
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:18,990
...you two go on,
and I'll bring the food up to you instead.

314
00:38:31,169 --> 00:38:32,504
Julie...

315
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:41,221
...you are very lucky
to have such a lovely daughter.

316
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:57,797
Oh...

317
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:00,258
...I'm sorry.
I didn't know she was asleep.

318
00:40:00,592 --> 00:40:01,593
Goodnight, dears.

319
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:03,428
Frances?

320
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:06,556
Yes?

321
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,061
I heard this house was a sort of
legend in Lake Village.

322
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:14,606
I've heard these stories too, dear.

323
00:40:15,315 --> 00:40:16,733
I figured.

324
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:20,445
There's nothing here I don't know about...

325
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:22,364
...I assure you.

326
00:40:23,865 --> 00:40:25,200
Good night, dear.

327
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:30,664
And if you have trouble seeing the ghouls,
you know where the lamps are.

328
00:41:58,251 --> 00:41:59,627
Julie?

329
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:04,215
Is that you?

330
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,387
Yes, yes mam.
I just broke your lamp.

331
00:42:10,263 --> 00:42:11,806
Are you hurt?

332
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,394
I'll be fine.

333
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:25,653
Do you need something?

334
00:42:26,863 --> 00:42:27,864
Yes...

335
00:42:28,406 --> 00:42:30,867
...uh, yes, oil.
I needed oil.

336
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:32,283
And um...

337
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:33,993
...I didn't know you were in here.

338
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:36,164
I thought you were in bed, so...

339
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,376
...and now I'm intruding.

340
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:43,046
So I apologise,
and I'll get a broom.

341
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:46,174
That's okay. I'll sweep it up when I'm done.

342
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:50,011
Then you can use my lamp.

343
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:52,138
And I'll leave you to it.

344
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,225
And I apologise again.

345
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:00,480
Frances?

346
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:03,108
Yes?

347
00:43:04,442 --> 00:43:06,569
You're forgetting your oil.

348
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:08,822
So I am.

349
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:11,533
I'll just go to bed instead.

350
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,071
Hello?

351
00:45:54,112 --> 00:45:55,113
Momma?

352
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:01,119
Momma?

353
00:46:04,497 --> 00:46:06,499
Go back to sleep, baby.

354
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,211
Julie?

355
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:11,601
Hello?

356
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:32,288
Hello?

357
00:49:42,465 --> 00:49:44,383
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

358
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:46,636
It's okay.

359
00:49:48,387 --> 00:49:49,972
Where's your little one?

360
00:49:50,097 --> 00:49:51,098
What?

361
00:49:51,432 --> 00:49:53,432
I've been looking for both of you...

362
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:54,435
Oh my god...

363
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:56,771
...where is she?

364
00:49:56,854 --> 00:49:58,103
I have no idea.

365
00:49:58,105 --> 00:49:59,104
Mrs. Frances!

366
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:01,899
Ellie, where have you been?
Your mother is worried sick.

367
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:04,026
Elllie. Where have you been?

368
00:50:04,028 --> 00:50:06,239
Jesus Christ.
WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE ME?

369
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:13,996
Where did you find that, dear?

370
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,501
Answer her.

371
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:20,545
Where did you get this?

372
00:50:22,463 --> 00:50:24,257
You're stilling things too, now, huh?

373
00:50:25,007 --> 00:50:26,008
Give it back.

374
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:33,766
Now go in there and get your clothes on.
You're coming with me.

375
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:36,852
But I want to stay and play with my dolls.

376
00:50:37,812 --> 00:50:39,772
Well, you can just forget about that now.

377
00:50:40,147 --> 00:50:41,148
GO.

378
00:50:49,073 --> 00:50:50,866
I hope she hasn't hurt anything.

379
00:50:51,242 --> 00:50:52,660
It's fine.

380
00:50:54,412 --> 00:50:56,414
You needn't be so hard on her.

381
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:58,416
It's nothing, really.

382
00:51:01,002 --> 00:51:03,212
You forgot this in the bathroom.

383
00:51:57,862 --> 00:52:00,543
Momma, do you believe in ghosts?

384
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,173
No, I don't.

385
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:08,192
Why not?

386
00:52:10,413 --> 00:52:12,268
Why should I?

387
00:52:18,608 --> 00:52:20,590
Ellie, why do you ask me that?

388
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:24,099
You told Jonathan that you saw somebody.

389
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,402
Listen...

390
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:43,907
...you've been snooping around.
Ellie's been exploring.

391
00:52:44,063 --> 00:52:45,699
I'm sure they expected that.

392
00:52:46,837 --> 00:52:49,127
It's easier to say the door's locked
and they don't have a key...

393
00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:51,872
...so they don't have to worry about you two.

394
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:56,081
Everybody's got something to hide, Julie.

395
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,915
Just let it go.

396
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:06,311
Or you can come stay with me.

397
00:53:11,206 --> 00:53:15,387
I bet my place is looking
a little more attractive to you now, isn't it?

398
00:53:15,683 --> 00:53:19,284
'Cause there's no ghosts in my house,
and that's a fact.

399
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,809
Momma doesn't believe in ghosts.

400
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,804
Well, that's good, Ellie.

401
00:53:29,036 --> 00:53:30,858
Ellie, why don't you go play.

402
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,107
Here.

403
00:53:40,805 --> 00:53:42,410
I can't stay with you.

404
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,967
Yes...

405
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:46,167
...you can.

406
00:53:46,993 --> 00:53:50,756
Look, nothing's going to happen.
I'll even sleep in another room - I swear.

407
00:53:52,097 --> 00:53:54,529
I'm not gonna go through this with you again.

408
00:53:56,929 --> 00:53:59,345
We are not stupid kids anymore, Julie.

409
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,291
Well, you're not the one that had to leave.

410
00:54:05,066 --> 00:54:06,484
Let's not start this.

411
00:54:07,435 --> 00:54:10,364
You're trying way too hard to be mad at me,
and you shouldn't.

412
00:54:11,518 --> 00:54:13,560
I'm a charming mother fucker.

413
00:54:15,415 --> 00:54:16,413
Hey...

414
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:17,893
...you need another round?

415
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:20,171
No.

416
00:54:21,665 --> 00:54:24,050
Bartender, two more!

417
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,121
Ellie, let's go to Mamaw's.

418
00:54:34,073 --> 00:54:35,335
More for me.

419
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,860
Ellie?

420
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:41,149
Sure was nice to meet you.

421
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:42,601
Bye.

422
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,781
Bye.

423
00:54:48,307 --> 00:54:49,307
Bye.

424
00:55:07,853 --> 00:55:09,194
Come inside.

425
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,095
It stinks inside.

426
00:55:11,454 --> 00:55:12,454
Ellie.

427
00:55:12,919 --> 00:55:14,213
It's cold.

428
00:55:15,787 --> 00:55:17,392
Well, it's cold out here.

429
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:19,842
C'mon.

430
00:55:25,638 --> 00:55:28,117
Fine, but don't go roaming around, okay?

431
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:04,053
This is from Mamaw.

432
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:41,821
Frances.

433
00:58:41,824 --> 00:58:43,123
Julie.

434
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:45,944
Did you find what you were looking for?

435
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:51,096
I suppose.

436
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:54,833
I'll go back tomorrow morning,
but that's pretty much it.

437
00:58:56,306 --> 00:58:59,181
Was it harder than you thought it would be?

438
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:02,554
I don't remember what I thought it would be.

439
00:59:04,627 --> 00:59:06,194
It's just lonlier.

440
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:15,201
You never get used to it...

441
00:59:15,203 --> 00:59:16,583
...that feeling.

442
00:59:17,985 --> 00:59:18,985
You just...

443
00:59:20,082 --> 00:59:22,553
...learn how to deal with it.

444
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:50,870
What the hell?

445
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:51,006
I'm losing my mind.

446
01:02:10,802 --> 01:02:12,267
Ellie...

447
01:02:13,795 --> 01:02:14,755
...Ellie, get up.

448
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:16,102
I'm sleepy, Momma.

449
01:02:16,104 --> 01:02:18,381
C'mon, Ellie.
Ellie, we're going to Jonathan's.

450
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:20,316
Get up!

451
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,187
Ellie!

452
01:02:55,993 --> 01:02:58,019
Ellie, get up,
and put your shoes on.

453
01:02:59,702 --> 01:03:02,446
ELLIE, GET UP BEFORE I WHOOP YOUR ASS!

454
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:32,750
My shoes...

455
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:34,215
I don't care.

456
01:03:34,714 --> 01:03:36,584
Get over here now.

457
01:04:11,827 --> 01:04:13,433
I'm really scared.

458
01:04:18,078 --> 01:04:19,078
Okay...

459
01:04:19,512 --> 01:04:20,512
...this is what we're gonna do.

460
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:25,019
We're gonna go back in there,
and we're gonna get all our things...

461
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:26,578
...and we're gonna go.

462
01:04:26,718 --> 01:04:27,718
Okay?

463
01:04:28,183 --> 01:04:30,630
We're about to leave,
and we're never coming back.

464
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:18,603
Going somewhere?

465
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:22,748
I hope we didn't wake you.

466
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:25,133
Oh, you didn't wake me.

467
01:05:27,471 --> 01:05:28,641
Are you leaving?

468
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,100
No.

469
01:05:31,455 --> 01:05:32,531
Oh, yes.

470
01:05:33,217 --> 01:05:34,510
Just for the night.

471
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:36,030
Uh...

472
01:05:36,381 --> 01:05:36,833
...I...

473
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:38,327
...told a friend I'd come by...

474
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:39,981
Will I see you again?

475
01:05:43,192 --> 01:05:44,192
Yes.

476
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,640
Good.

477
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:56,504
Bye, sweetheart.

478
01:05:59,649 --> 01:06:00,649
Good night.

479
01:06:41,953 --> 01:06:43,418
Is that her?

480
01:06:44,384 --> 01:06:45,912
You piece of shit...

481
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:47,224
RONNIE!

482
01:06:47,814 --> 01:06:50,212
YOU KNOW HE'S FUCKING ME TOO, RIGHT?

483
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,212
Get the hell out of here.

484
01:06:51,214 --> 01:06:51,953
NOW.

485
01:06:51,955 --> 01:06:53,639
I'm done with you, asshole.

486
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:56,538
I'm done with all y'all.

487
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:04,258
Ain't nothing to see here, folks.

488
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:07,543
Hey.

489
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,549
See that nice lady over there?
That's my sister, Rhonda, okay?

490
01:07:10,682 --> 01:07:11,615
She knows all about you.

491
01:07:11,617 --> 01:07:13,641
Why don't you go see if
she's got some peanuts for you, okay?

492
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:14,921
It's okay, Ellie.

493
01:07:14,976 --> 01:07:15,976
Rhonda!

494
01:07:28,346 --> 01:07:30,575
Hey, what the hell is going on with you?

495
01:07:31,152 --> 01:07:31,820
Me?

496
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:32,822
Yeah.

497
01:07:35,329 --> 01:07:36,607
Here, here, here, here.

498
01:07:39,444 --> 01:07:41,393
Calm down for a second, okay?

499
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,837
Can we stay with you tonight?

500
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:48,251
Yeah, we can go there now if you want.

501
01:07:48,812 --> 01:07:51,493
What's the matter?
You're really starting to freak me out here.

502
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:55,748
I don't want to talk about it.
I just want to know if we can stay with you.

503
01:07:58,211 --> 01:07:59,411
Yeah, of course.

504
01:07:59,832 --> 01:08:00,832
Of course.

505
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:14,331
Hey...

506
01:08:14,547 --> 01:08:15,547
Hey.

507
01:08:16,012 --> 01:08:17,976
Can I buy you a drink or something?

508
01:08:20,236 --> 01:08:21,236
Yeah.

509
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:22,557
We...

510
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:24,848
...we can go now if you want.
Rhonda can close up the bar.

511
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,142
It's fine.
It's fine.

512
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,144
It's just...

513
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,851
...I'll be alright.

514
01:08:32,846 --> 01:08:33,846
Okay.

515
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:35,109
Hey...

516
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:36,946
...let's go on in, alright?

517
01:08:44,693 --> 01:08:46,594
It's gonna be okay.

518
01:08:47,576 --> 01:08:48,576
Thank you.

519
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:28,605
Heeeeeey.

520
01:09:28,774 --> 01:09:29,774
Hey.

521
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:33,203
Welcome, uh...

522
01:09:33,434 --> 01:09:35,009
...to my place.

523
01:09:35,196 --> 01:09:37,284
This place is really nice...

524
01:09:39,077 --> 01:09:40,072
Come in?

525
01:09:40,074 --> 01:09:40,075
Come in?
...much nicer than where we used to live.

526
01:09:40,077 --> 01:09:42,179
...much nicer than where we used to live.

527
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:45,062
No, not really.

528
01:09:45,888 --> 01:09:46,888
C'mon.

529
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:51,999
I guess you'll see when you come in.

530
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:25,675
What sounds good?

531
01:10:27,312 --> 01:10:29,572
I got beer, whiskey, scotch...

532
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:31,996
...water.

533
01:10:33,944 --> 01:10:34,944
Yes.

534
01:10:36,559 --> 01:10:38,460
Yeah, you're gonna need water.

535
01:10:41,656 --> 01:10:43,589
Stop messing with my wallet.

536
01:11:05,707 --> 01:11:07,406
What do you want to do?

537
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,911
I'm a responsible adult...

538
01:11:12,908 --> 01:11:14,512
...with a child...

539
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:16,353
...and responsibilities.

540
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,027
What the hell you talking about?

541
01:11:24,646 --> 01:11:26,873
Are you asking to sleep with me?

542
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:34,047
No.

543
01:11:40,311 --> 01:11:41,916
I'm tired.

544
01:11:57,192 --> 01:11:58,610
What's wrong with you now?

545
01:12:57,632 --> 01:12:58,632
Hey!

546
01:13:03,143 --> 01:13:04,483
Did you sleep okay?

547
01:13:09,876 --> 01:13:11,700
I like Jonathan.

548
01:13:33,273 --> 01:13:34,273
Coming in?

549
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,660
No.

550
01:13:42,516 --> 01:13:45,563
It'll probably be the last time
you get to see Mamaw's house.

551
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,279
If you get cold, you come inside, okay?

552
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:07,622
Okay.

553
01:14:50,915 --> 01:14:52,442
What you doing in there, Ellie?

554
01:14:52,895 --> 01:14:53,814
Colouring.

555
01:14:54,173 --> 01:14:55,482
What you colouring?

556
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:59,081
A picture of my mom, and me, and the car.

557
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:00,454
What kind of car is that?

558
01:15:00,984 --> 01:15:01,984
Herbie car.

559
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:03,365
Ah, well that's cool.

560
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:05,189
That's a pretty picture.

561
01:15:05,392 --> 01:15:06,392
Thank you.

562
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,704
You ran away.

563
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:22,499
I just came by to...

564
01:15:23,138 --> 01:15:24,806
...say goodbye before you head out.

565
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:26,367
Again.

566
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:52,941
I just...

567
01:15:53,143 --> 01:15:54,466
...I just want to go...

568
01:15:54,468 --> 01:15:55,468
...forever.

569
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:58,334
You're welcome to join us.

570
01:16:01,046 --> 01:16:02,636
That'd be real nice, huh?

571
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,731
Maybe some other time.

572
01:16:15,963 --> 01:16:18,083
You be good to your momma, Ellie.

573
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,007
Bye, Jonathan.

574
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:39,064
My offer with always stand
if you ever make your way back here again, okay?

575
01:17:01,135 --> 01:17:03,240
Momma, why can't we stay?

576
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:05,858
Because, baby.

577
01:17:07,994 --> 01:17:09,973
I want to go with Jonathan.

578
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,120
I didn't ask you what you wanted to do.

579
01:17:13,122 --> 01:17:14,696
Let's go inside, now.

580
01:17:23,441 --> 01:17:24,441
Really?

581
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:33,150
Well, you can stay out here...

582
01:17:33,152 --> 01:17:34,913
...but I got the keys.

583
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,876
I'M NOT GOING INSIDE.

584
01:19:20,864 --> 01:19:26,047
Today, I spoke with Fran
and expressed my sorrow.

585
01:19:27,294 --> 01:19:32,406
Words can not express the sorrow I feel.

586
01:19:33,404 --> 01:19:38,330
How could a loving God
take someone so young.

587
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:41,545
Fran...

588
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:44,660
Fran...

589
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,546
Fran has gone silent.

590
01:20:02,323 --> 01:20:04,116
I cannot blame her.

591
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:07,452
I cannot blame her.

592
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:13,371
I pray the last words she says to me aren't...

593
01:20:14,556 --> 01:20:19,014
...I just want to die. I just want to die.

594
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:33,273
Where are you?

595
01:22:33,275 --> 01:22:34,803
It's time to go.

596
01:22:37,983 --> 01:22:38,983
Ellie?

597
01:22:56,765 --> 01:23:03,863
And so it is that we are, all of us,
possessed of both love and hate...

598
01:23:03,865 --> 01:23:05,564
...and we'd do well to remember that.

599
01:23:06,031 --> 01:23:07,341
Let us pray.

600
01:23:07,824 --> 01:23:10,505
That little dolly belonged to my daughter.

601
01:23:10,957 --> 01:23:12,968
And she wants you to have it.

602
01:23:13,778 --> 01:23:15,166
You have a daughter?

603
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,691
Yes.

604
01:23:16,693 --> 01:23:19,078
And she's just about your age.

605
01:23:19,624 --> 01:23:21,603
Would you like to meet her?

606
01:23:22,928 --> 01:23:27,505
Dear Heavenly Father,
it is through your grace alone that we are saved.

607
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:31,246
In the name of The Father and The Son...

608
01:23:39,874 --> 01:23:42,180
One last time...

609
01:23:45,547 --> 01:23:52,866
♪ What a peace is mine,
leaning on the everlasting arms. ♪

610
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,162
ELLIE?

611
01:24:05,285 --> 01:24:06,285
ELLIE?

612
01:24:32,157 --> 01:24:33,157
Ellie?

613
01:25:37,998 --> 01:25:39,557
Oh dear...

614
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:42,799
...what has your mother done?

615
01:25:53,804 --> 01:25:54,804
You...

616
01:25:55,634 --> 01:25:56,442
No...

617
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:57,956
What have you done to her?

618
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,735
No, uh, I...
... I did nothing.

619
01:26:00,078 --> 01:26:01,078
It was Frances.

620
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:29,764
ELLIE!

621
01:26:44,292 --> 01:26:45,292
ELLIE!

622
01:26:52,107 --> 01:26:53,107
ELLIE!

623
01:27:25,822 --> 01:27:27,693
I know it's you.

624
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,166
Ellie?

625
01:27:33,445 --> 01:27:35,050
Ellie isn't here.

626
01:27:44,512 --> 01:27:46,055
Listen here, Frances.

627
01:27:47,177 --> 01:27:49,079
Get that thing away from me,
and give me my daughter.

628
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,446
She's not your daughter.

629
01:27:51,448 --> 01:27:52,601
Not anymore...

630
01:27:56,935 --> 01:27:58,478
You're fucking crazy.

631
01:28:03,902 --> 01:28:04,900
Ellie?

632
01:28:04,902 --> 01:28:07,298
Oh, do not listen to her, LaDell baby.

633
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:08,765
She's not your mother.

634
01:28:11,992 --> 01:28:13,582
Careful, dear.

635
01:28:13,769 --> 01:28:15,686
The spirits are on my side...

636
01:28:16,356 --> 01:28:18,461
...and you wouldn't want to get them angry.

637
01:28:19,786 --> 01:28:20,861
There are no spirits.

638
01:28:21,516 --> 01:28:22,841
You're fucking crazy.

639
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:29,036
Mommy?

640
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:30,221
Shh, shh, shh.

641
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:32,307
Don't cry, baby.

642
01:28:32,338 --> 01:28:33,556
SHE'S NOT YOUR BABY!

643
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:36,763
Yes...

644
01:28:36,765 --> 01:28:38,230
...yes, she is.

645
01:28:38,807 --> 01:28:40,381
Julie, do you know why?

646
01:28:40,646 --> 01:28:42,935
Because you are a terrible mother...

647
01:28:42,937 --> 01:28:46,180
...ungrateful for what God has given you.

648
01:28:47,037 --> 01:28:49,297
So now, He's taken her...

649
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,854
...He's taken yours...

650
01:28:50,856 --> 01:28:51,866
...and given

651
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:52,497
...and given my

652
01:28:52,499 --> 01:28:53,074
...and given my baby

653
01:28:53,076 --> 01:28:54,268
...and given my baby back.

654
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:12,588
Come here, baby.

655
01:29:16,516 --> 01:29:17,879
Let's go home.

656
01:29:20,864 --> 01:29:23,146
No, do not leave with my baby.

657
01:29:23,148 --> 01:29:23,769
No.

658
01:29:23,771 --> 01:29:24,892
No, dont!

659
01:29:24,894 --> 01:29:27,047
Please, don't take her away from me...

660
01:29:27,049 --> 01:29:27,051
Please, don't take her away from me...
...again.

661
01:29:27,053 --> 01:29:30,260
...again.

662
01:31:46,848 --> 01:31:51,848
