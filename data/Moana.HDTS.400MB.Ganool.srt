16
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:56,206
In the beginning,
there was only ocean

17
00:00:56,752 --> 00:01:00,760
Untill the Mother Island image...

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,798
...Te Fiti.

19
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:07,165
Her heart have a greatest
power ever known...

20
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:10,332
...each could create life itself.

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,935
And Te Fiti share it with the world.

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,448
But in time,
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart

23
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:27,177
They believe that they could possesed
the great power of creation would prevails

24
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:30,200
And one day...

25
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:33,361
The most tearing of them all.

26
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:37,727
A boy across the ocean to take it.

27
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:43,649
He was a demigod
of the wind and sea.

28
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:47,492
He was a warrior.

29
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:49,805
A trickster!

30
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:58,409
A shape shifter who could change
form with the power of his magical fish hook.

31
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,748
And his name...

32
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:04,290
...was Maui

33
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:17,853
But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble.

34
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,627
Giving birth to a
terrible darkness.

35
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:43,531
Maui trying to escape,
but was confronted by another...

36
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,786
...who soak the heart.

37
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,205
Te Kā!
A demon of earth and fire.

38
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:03,125
Maui distract from the sky.

39
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:05,715
Never to be seen again.

40
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,864
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

41
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:15,182
...were lost to the sea.

42
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:19,109
Were even know,
a thousand years later...

43
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,038
Te Kā and the demons of deeds...

44
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,824
...Still hunt for the heart.

45
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:28,587
Hiding in the darkness
that will continue to spread...

46
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,577
...Chasing away our fish...

47
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:34,268
...Drawning the life
from island of the island...

48
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:36,649
...Untill every one of us...

49
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:44,012
...is devoured by the bloodlusted joys
of inescapeable death!

50
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:52,595
But one day,
the heart will be found...

51
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:55,818
...By someone who would
journey beyond the reef...

52
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,571
...find Maui, deliver him
across the great ocean...

53
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,635
...to restore Te Fiti's heart
and save us all.

54
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:06,358
Woo! Ho! Ho! Thank you, Mother.
That's enough.

55
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,524
- Papa!
- No one goes outside the reef.

56
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:12,746
We're safe here.
There's no darkness.

57
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:14,585
There's no monsters.

58
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,786
- Monsters! Monsters!
- There's no monsters! No monsters!

59
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:21,334
- Please, monsters. Don't eat us!
- Ah, hey! Ah!

60
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,169
No there is nothin' beyond our reef
but the storm and rusty...

61
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:26,114
I'm gettin' throw up!

62
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:30,153
As long as we stay on our
very safe island, we'll be fine.

63
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:33,344
The legends are true.
Someone will have to go!

64
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:38,782
Mother, more two new years paradise
Who would want to go anywhere else?

65
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,101
Shoo! Shooo!

66
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:36,523


67
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:57,559
~ <i>Ou mata e matagi</i> ~
I would wind

68
00:05:58,146 --> 00:06:04,191
~ <i>Ou loto mamaina toa</i> ~
I will clean the hero

69
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:10,124
~ <i>Manatu atu</i> ~
Consideration

70
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:16,883
~ <i>Taku pelepele</i> ~
Taku the dearest

71
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:22,823
~ <i>Pa mai to mafanafanaga</i> ~
Explosion took comfort

72
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:30,068
~ <i>Saolotoga tenei</i> ~
Freedom of tenei

73
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:36,109
~ Manatunatu ~
Consider

74
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:42,290
~ <i>Ki tamafine</i> ~
Key of tamafine

75
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,546
~ <i>Maua ai te lumanai</i> ~
Have you come

76
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:55,153
~ <i>Ki tamafine</i> ~
Key of tamafine

77
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,019
Moana!

78
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:12,159
~ <i>Ou mata e matagi</i> ~
I would wind

79
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:17,607
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

80
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:20,401
- Moana wants to go back!
- I know. I know...

81
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:24,123
...But you don't go out there.
It's dangerous.

82
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:30,060
Moana, come on.
Just go back to the village.

83
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:34,234
You're the next great chief
for our people.

84
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,322
And you'll do wonderest things!
My little minno!

85
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:41,774
Oh yes. But first, you must learn
where you meant to be.

86
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,505
Moana

87
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,641
Make way
Make way

88
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,396
Moana it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is...

89
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,515
...All you need.

90
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:08,753
The dances are practicing
They dance to an ancient soul

91
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:11,999
Who needs a new song?
This old one's all we need

92
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,372
This tradition is our mission
And Moana there's so much to do

93
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:20,771
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need

94
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:22,984
We share everything we make
<i>We make!</i>

95
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,736
We joke and we weave our baskets
<i>Aha!</i>

96
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:27,222
The fisherman come back
from the sea

97
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,103
I wanna see

98
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:32,912
Don't walk away
Moana stay on the ground now

99
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:37,119
Our people will need
a chief and there you are

100
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:41,258
There comes a day
When you're gonna look around

101
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,080
And realize happiness is

102
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Where you are!

103
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:47,428
Consider the coconut
<i>The what?</i>

104
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:48,578
Consider its tree

105
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:53,349
We use each part of the coconut
That's all we need

106
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:55,611
We make our nets from the fibers

107
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:57,319
The water is sweet inside

108
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,476
We use the leaves to build fires

109
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,359
We cook up the meat inside

110
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:03,621
Consider the coconuts

111
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,287
The trunks and the leaves

112
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:07,962
The island gives us what we need

113
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:09,764
And no one leaves

114
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:11,533
That's right, we stay

115
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,800
We're safe and we're well provided

116
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:15,660
And when we look to the future

117
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,843
There you are

118
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,668
You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did

119
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:23,657
You must find happiness right

120
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:27,167
Where you are?

121
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,271
I like to dance with the water

122
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,382
The undertow and the waves

123
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:37,859
The water is mischievous

124
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:40,563
Ha! I like how it misbehaves

125
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,647
The village may think I'm crazy

126
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,517
Or say that I drift too far

127
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:46,618
But once you know what you like, well

128
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:50,256
There you are

129
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:53,626
You are your father's daughter

130
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:55,483
Stubbornness and pride

131
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,483
Mind what he says but remember

132
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,539
You may hear a voice inside

133
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:01,943
And if the voice starts to whisper

134
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,237
To follow the farthest star

135
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,157
Moana, that voice inside is

136
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:10,087
Who you are

137
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,523
Dad!
I was only looking on the boat...

138
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,379
...I wasn't get on 'em.

139
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,057
Come on! There's something
i need to show you.

140
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:29,445
I've wanted to bring you here
for the moment to you open your eyes.

141
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:31,722
This is a secret place.

142
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,908
A place of chiefs.

143
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,837
There will come a time...

144
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:38,670
...When you will stand on this
picken' place...

145
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,114
...A stone on this mountain...

146
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:42,114
...Like i did.

147
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,813
Like my father did.

148
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:47,452
And his father and every chiefs
that is ever been.

149
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:52,360
And you'll meet the day
when you at your stone.

150
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:55,876
You will raise this whole island
higher!

151
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,789
You are the future of our people, Moana.

152
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:07,710
It's time to be
who they need you to be.

153
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:12,061
We make our nets from the fibers

154
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,032
The water is sweet inside

155
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:16,165
We use the leaves to build fires

156
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:17,908
We cook up the meat inside

157
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,999
The village believes in us
That's right!

158
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:21,999
The village believes

159
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,205
The island gives us what we need

160
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,023
And no one leaves

161
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:28,158
So here I'll stay

162
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:30,134
My home, my people beside me

163
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:32,072
And when I think of tomorrow

164
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,317
There we are

165
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,245
I'll lead the way

166
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:38,312
I'll have my people to guide me

167
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,134
We'll build our future together

168
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:42,166
Where we are

169
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,147
'Cause every path leads you back to

170
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,259
Where you are

171
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:48,217
You can find happiness right

172
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:50,150
Where you are

173
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:53,323
Where you are!

174
00:11:57,268 --> 00:12:00,800
Every storm, this roof leaves
no mather how many fronts i add.

175
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:01,823
Fixed!

176
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:03,090
Not the fronts...

177
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,132
...Wind shift to the boost.

178
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,132
That's good work!

179
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,045
Ate me!
No, i wasn't.

180
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:18,976
What? They're going in
so i gotta... bye!

181
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:25,569
- You're doing great.
- Is it done yet? Aw! Aw!

182
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:29,323
- So close!
- Aw! My aw! Aw!

183
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,683
I've curious about that
chicken eating the rocks.

184
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:50,881
He needs selectives intelligence
required. Pretty much everything?

185
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:54,158
Should we maybe just...
cook him?

186
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:58,072
Uhh... sometimes our shames like
beneath the service.

187
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:02,476
Far beneath...
in some cases...

188
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,808
But i'm sure there's more than
hey hey and miss the act.

189
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:17,304
It's the harvest, this morning
i was husking the coconuts and...

190
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:27,334
Well... we should clear the
desease trees.

191
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:30,278
And we will start a new grow...

192
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:31,668
...There!

193
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:37,743
Thanks, Moana.
She's doing great!

194
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,559
- This suits you.
- Chief!

195
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,176
There's something you need to see.

196
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:51,288
Our traps in the east laggon
They boobing up recentless fish.

197
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:53,788
Then we'll...
roated the fishing grounds.

198
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:56,383
Uhh... we have...
There's no fish.

199
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,684
Then we'll fish the far side of the alley.

200
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:02,265
- We tried.
- The side?

201
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:07,039
We've tried the whole lagoon.

202
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,707
They're just...
gone.

203
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:22,486
I would talk to the consult
I'm sure we can...

204
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,379
Why didn't we fish beyond the reef?

205
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,252
- No one goes beyond the reef.
- I know! But...

206
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:31,561
- If there are no fish in the lagoon...
- Moana!

207
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,419
- ...And there's a whole ocean
- We have one rule!

208
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:35,990
An old rule when there were fish!

209
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:39,804
A rule that keep us safe.
Instead of dangering our people...

210
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,439
So you can run right back
through the water.

211
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,480
Everytime i think you're pass this.

212
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,597
No one goes beyond the reef!

213
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:05,561
Well, it's like what you said
in front of your dad.

214
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:08,644
Standing on the boat.

215
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:13,183
I didn't say, "Go beyond the reef!"
Because i want to beyond the ocean.

216
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,009
But you still to.

217
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,175
- He is hard on you beacuse...
- Beacuse he doesn't get me.

218
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:21,795
Beacuse he was you.

219
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:26,541
Drown to the ocean.
Dawn by the sure.

220
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:30,747
He crossed the reef.

221
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:34,026
And founded unforgiving sea.

222
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:36,630
Waste like mountains.

223
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,985
His best friend beg to be on that boat.

224
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:42,862
Your dad couldn't save him.

225
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:47,993
He is hoping he can save you.

226
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:56,280
Sometimes who we wish we were
What we wish we could do.

227
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:59,073
It's just not meant to be.

228
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:19,048
Okay, Pua.
I can do this.

229
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:23,630
There's more fish beyond the reef.

230
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:26,878
There's more beyond the reef.

231
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,328
Not so bad.

232
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:46,818
Pua!

233
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,092
Whatever just happened...

234
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:42,602
...Blame it on the beg.

235
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:43,997
Grandma!

236
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,195
Are you gonna tell dad?

237
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:53,352
I miss mom.
I don't have to tell her anything.

238
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,995
He was right...

239
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,320
...About going out there.

240
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:07,029
It's time to put my stone
on the mountain.

241
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:12,543
Okay!
Well, then head on back!

242
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:14,706
Put that stone up there.

243
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:21,693
Why don't you try talk to me out of it?

244
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,019
You said that's what you wanted.

245
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,234
It is.

246
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,352
When i die...

247
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:35,424
...I'm going to come back
one of these.

248
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:38,862
Or i choose the wrong tattoo.

249
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:40,797
Why are you acting weird?

250
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:44,788
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

251
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,819
If there's something you want to tell me.
Just tell me.

252
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,839
Is there something
you want to tell me?

253
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:55,289
Is there something you want to hear?

254
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:03,121
You've been told all our people
stories...

255
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,851
...But one!

256
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:07,827
What is this place?

257
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:12,667
Do you really think our ancestors
stayed within the reef?

258
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:25,417
What's in there?

259
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:30,758
Diansa.
To the question you keep asking yourself.

260
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,825
Who are you meant to be?

261
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:38,544
Go inside,...

262
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:40,306
...Band the drum,...

263
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,944
...And find out!

264
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:53,058
This sub is transcripted by
P E N N Y H A M A D A

265
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:52,612
Band the drum.

266
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:47,998
We read the wind and the sky

267
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:49,784
When the sun is high

268
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,683
We sail the length of the seas

269
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,975
On the ocean breeze

270
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,081
At night we name every star

271
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:02,440
We know where we are

272
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:09,488
Aue, aue
We set a course to find

273
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:14,216
A brand new island everywere we roam

274
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:19,239
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind

275
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,001
And when it's time to find home

276
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:24,388
We know the way

277
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:27,485
We read the wind and the sky

278
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,319
When the sun is high

279
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:32,392
We sail the length of the seas

280
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,186
On the ocean breeze

281
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:37,265
At night we name every star

282
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:39,714
We know where we are

283
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:43,857
We know who we are, who we are

284
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,645
Aue, aue
We set a course to find

285
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:53,455
A brand new island everywere we roam

286
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:58,684
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind

287
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:00,986
And when it's time to find home

288
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:03,431
We know the way

289
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:08,391
Aue, aue
We are explorers reading every sign

290
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:11,163
We tell the stories of our elders

291
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:13,505
In a never-ending chain

292
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:18,307
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind

293
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:20,696
And when it's time to find home

294
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:25,545
We know the way

295
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:30,611
We were voyagers.

296
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:33,405
We were voyagers!

297
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:39,833
We were voyagers!

298
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:41,945
Why'd we stop?

299
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:44,405
Maui...

300
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:47,683
...When he stole from the mother island.

301
00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:51,442
Darkness felt.
Te Ka awoke.

302
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:55,417
Monsters looked and both
stop coming back.

303
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:59,408
To protect our people,
the ancient chief forbid voyaging...

304
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:03,302
...And now we have
forgotten who we are.

305
00:24:03,897 --> 00:24:07,619
And the darkness has continued to spread.

306
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:16,446
Chasing away our fish,
Draining the life from island after island.

307
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,422
Our island.

308
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:26,120
But one day,
Someone would journey beyond our reef.

309
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:31,405
Find Maui,
Deliver him across the great ocean,...

310
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:35,599
...To restore
The Heart of Te Fiti.

311
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:42,516
I was tell that day,
the ocean choose you.

312
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:53,944
I thought it was a dream.

313
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:01,153
Nope!

314
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:06,097
Our ancestors believes
Maui lies there.

315
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,272
At the bottom of his hook.

316
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:11,442
Follow it, and you will find him.

317
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,544
But why did it choose me?

318
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:17,868
I don't even know
how to make it pass the reef.

319
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:20,757
But i know who does!

320
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:32,424
- The crabs are turning black!
- What about the fish?

321
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,615
- This is happening all over the island.
- Please, please, settle down.

322
00:25:34,631 --> 00:25:36,440
- What do you going to do?
- We would take new field

323
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,750
- We will find a way to...
- We can stop the darkness!

324
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:40,123
Save our island!

325
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,416
These are covered the boats.
Huge canoes!

326
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,559
We can take them,
find Maui.

327
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,391
Make him restore the heart.

328
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:50,825
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

329
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:57,910
You told me to help our people.
This is how we help our people.

330
00:25:58,638 --> 00:26:00,750
Dad? What are you doing?

331
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,252
I should've burn those boats
a long time ago!

332
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:05,792
No! Don't!
We have to find Maui!

333
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,665
- We have to restore the heart.
- There is no heart!

334
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:11,030
This?
This is just a rock!

335
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:12,062
No!

336
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:25,993
Chief!

337
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:27,249
It's your mother!

338
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,629
Mother!

339
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,094
- What can be done?
- I don't know. I kinda something...

340
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:03,471
Go.

341
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:05,035
Grandma?

342
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:09,305
Go.

343
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,419
Not now. I can't.

344
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:17,067
You must.
The ocean choose you.

345
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:19,523
- Follow the fish hook...
- Grandma?

346
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,388
And when you find Maui...

347
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:26,800
...You grab him by the hear.
You say...

348
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:30,126
"I'm Moana of Mautunui...

349
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:35,096
...You will board my boat,
sail across the sea...

350
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:39,258
...And restore
The Heart of Te Fiti."

351
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:43,456
I... I can't leave you.

352
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:49,948
There is no way you could go
that i want be with you.

353
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:02,835
Go!

354
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:17,309
There's the light where the sky
meets the sea

355
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:20,301
And it calls me

356
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:26,769
But no one knows
how far it goes

357
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:31,740
All the time wondering where need to be
is behind me

358
00:28:31,936 --> 00:28:32,936
-

359
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:41,326
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

360
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:44,197
Is a choice I make
No I can't turn back

361
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:50,797
From the great unknown
Where I go alone, Where I long to be

362
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:01,573
See her light at the night and the sea

363
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:04,441
She calls me

364
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:07,169
Yes I know!

365
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:10,534
That I can go!

366
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:15,755
There's a moon and the sky
And the wind is behind me

367
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:18,359
Soon I'll know

368
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:25,296
How far I'll go!

369
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:43,901
"I am Moana of Matunui...

370
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:47,176
...You will board my boat.
Sail across the sea...

371
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,620
...And restore
The Heart of Te Fiti."

372
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:51,423
"I am Moana...

373
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:53,732

...Nui...

375
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:09,346
HeiHei?

376
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:24,067
:'V

377

:'v

379
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:36,339
It's okay... You're alright.
Yeah, see?

380
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:42,367
There we go, nice water.
The ocean is a friend of mine.

381
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:45,766
HeiHei?

382
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:48,044
HeiHei!

383
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,045
Stay!

384
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:13,154
Okay, next stop,
Maui.

385
00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:24,001
"I am Moana of Matunui...

Wonder boat!

Oh no.

391
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,506
No! No! No! No! No!

392
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:53,636
No! Argh!

393
00:32:04,143 --> 00:32:09,332
Uhh... Ocean?
Can I get a little help?

394
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:13,699
No!

395
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:18,644
Please! Come on!
Uhh!

Please!

Umm...

399
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:18,004
What?!

400
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:22,576
I said help me!
And wrecking my boat?

401
00:33:22,822 --> 00:33:24,211
Not help me!

402
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:27,490
Fish pee in you!

403
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:28,959
All day...

404
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:30,181
So...

405
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,475
What?

406
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:45,617
Maui?

407
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:53,651
Maui!

408
00:33:57,253 --> 00:33:59,453
"Maui, demigod of wind and sea...

409

...I am Moana of Matunui...

410
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:03,769
...You will board my boat..
No!

411
00:34:03,912 --> 00:34:06,054
You will board my boat!
Yeah!

412
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:08,436
Hi! I'm Moana of Matunui...

413
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:11,171
You will board my...

414
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:12,243
Boat!

415
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:13,275
A boat!

416
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:16,076
The god have given me a...

417
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:17,092
AAARRRGGGHHH!

418
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,468
Maui...

419
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:32,516
Shapeshifter

420
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:34,556
Demigod of the wind and sea...

421
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,096
- I am Moana of Matu...
- Hero of man.

422
00:34:37,421 --> 00:34:39,421
- What?
- It's actualy Maui Shapeshifter...

423
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:40,929
...Demigod of the wind and sea.

424
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:42,278
Hero of man

425
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:45,579
Hero of man. Go!

426
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,730
- I am Moa...
- Sorry... Sorry...

427
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:52,048
...And women.
Man and women.

428
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:56,938
Both all. Not only a guy or girl or thing.
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

429
00:34:56,992 --> 00:34:58,059
You do it great.

430
00:34:58,413 --> 00:34:59,413
What? No!

431
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:00,111
I'm here to...

432
00:35:00,136 --> 00:35:05,476
Of course! Yes!
Maui always has time for his fans.

433
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:08,973
When you use a bird to ride with...

434
00:35:09,763 --> 00:35:11,363
...It's called tweeting.

435
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,727
I know not everyday
You gotta chance to meet a mature hero.

436
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:20,882
You are not my hero!

437
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:23,716
And i'm not here so you can
sign my orb!

438
00:35:23,803 --> 00:35:26,239
I'm here 'coz you stole
the heart of Te Fiti.

439
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:28,437
And you will board my boat...

440
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:31,681
...Sail across the sea
and put it back!

441
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,183
It almost sounds like
you don't like me...

442
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:38,715
...Which is impossible because
i stuck here...

443
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:42,493
For thousand years try to
get a hard as a gift for immortal.

444
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:46,089
So you can have the power
to create life itself.

445
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:49,430
Yeah, so what i believe
you were tryin' to say...

446
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:50,743
...Is thank you.

447
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:52,310
- Thank you?
- You welcome!

448
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:54,882
What? No! I didn't!
I wasn't!

449
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,779
- Why would i ever say... I mean...
- Okay... Okay...

450
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,549
I see what's happening yeaa

451
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:03,850
You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange

452
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:06,478
You don't even know how you feel

453
00:36:06,502 --> 00:36:08,272
It's adorable!

454
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,168
Well, it's nice to see
that humans never change

455
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:14,740
Open your eyes, let's begin

456
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:17,855
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui
Breathe it in!

457
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,070
I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod!

458
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,492
When you're staring at a demi-god

459
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:29,085
What can I say except you're welcome

460
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:32,416
For the tides, the sun, the sky

461
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:36,298
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

462
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:39,480
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
Hey!

463
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:42,805
What has two thumbs
that pulled up the sky

464
00:36:43,027 --> 00:36:46,206
When you were waddling yay high
This guy!

465
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:48,035
When the nights got cold

466
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,954
Who stole you fire from down below

467
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:52,740
You're lookin' at him, yo

468
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:57,224
Oh, also I lassoed the sun

469
00:36:57,272 --> 00:37:00,755
You're welcome!
To stretch the days and bring you fun

470
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:04,271
Also I harnessed the breeze

471
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:05,223
You welcome!

472
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:07,788
To fill your sails and shake your trees

473
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:11,700
So what can I say except
You're welcome

474
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:14,946
For the islands I pulled from the sea

475
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:18,731
There's no need to pray, it's okay
You're welcome!

476
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:22,079
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me

477
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,597
You're welcome!
You're welcome!

478
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:28,335
Well, come to think of it

479
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:30,295
Kid, honestly I can go on and on

480
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:32,334
I can explain every natural phenomenon

481
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:34,009
The tide, the grass, the ground, oh

482
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:35,565
That was Maui just messing around

483
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:37,272
I killed an eel
I buried its guts

484
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,105
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts

485
00:37:39,122 --> 00:37:40,915
What's the lesson
What is the take-away

486
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:42,843
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on the break-away

487
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:44,645
And the tapestry here on my skin

488
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:46,200
Is a map of the victories I win

489
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:47,994
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

490
00:37:48,026 --> 00:37:50,893
Look at that mini-Maui just tippity-tappin'

491
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:58,010
Well, anyway let me say
You're welcome

492
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:01,193
For the wonderful world you know

493
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:05,582
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome!

494
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:08,256
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go

495
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:12,645
Hey, it's your day to say
You're welcome

496
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:15,280
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

497
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,693
I'm sailing away, away
You're welcome!

498
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:22,058
'Cause Maui can do anything but float

499
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:24,216
You're welcome!
You're welcome!

500
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:26,382
You're welcome!
You're welcome!

501
00:38:27,812 --> 00:38:28,812
And thank you!

502
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,026
Hey! Let me out!

503
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,785
You lying! Slummy! Son of a...

504
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:39,099
You're welcome.
Ha! Ha!

505
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:47,621
No!

506
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:49,446
I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

507
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:50,415
I'm gonna get my hook.

508
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:52,669
You had yours and i'm not Maui
without mine.

509
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:56,477
Talk to the back.

510
00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:02,654
Boat snack!

511
00:39:28,886 --> 00:39:32,035
You're radience

512
00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:35,354
Oh no! Don't look at me like that!

513
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,303
It's a beautifull cave
She's gonna love it.

514
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,617
Now i'm going to love you...

515
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,069
...In my belly.

516
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:44,542
Now let's fetch you up, dumb stick.

517
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,350
I could watch that all day.

518
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:13,058
Okay, enjoy the island!
Maui out!

519
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:15,520
No! Stop! Hey!

520
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:17,869
You will put back the heart!

521
00:40:33,425 --> 00:40:35,406
Did not see that coming.

522
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:40,211
I am Moana of Matunui

523
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:43,819
This is my canoe
And you will journey to the...

524
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:48,580
Alright, get over it.
We gotta move.

525
00:40:50,663 --> 00:40:51,663
And she's back.

526
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:54,845
I am Moana of Matunu...

527
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:02,053
- It was Moana, right?
- Yes...

528
00:41:02,102 --> 00:41:04,919
...And you will restore the heart.

529
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:17,010
Alright, i'm out.

530
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,210
Argh! Come on!

531
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:26,106
What is your problem?

532
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:28,265
Are...

533
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:29,710
...You afraid of it?

534
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,924
No!

535
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,059
I'm not afraid.

536
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:38,924
Stay out of it,
or you'll sleeping in my armpit

537
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:41,487
You stop it, that is not a heart...

538
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,686
It is a curse, last time i took it...

539
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:46,384
...I got blasted out of a sky
and i lost my hook...

540
00:41:46,408 --> 00:41:48,290
Get it away from me!

541
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:52,400
- Get... this away?
- Hey! I'm a demigod, okay? Stop that!

542
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,654
I will smite you!

543
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:56,350
You wanna get smote?
Smoten?

544
00:41:57,408 --> 00:42:00,273
Listen, that thing doesn't give
you power to create life.

545
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:02,225
It's a homing become of death.

546
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,790
If you don't put it away back,
things will gonna come for it.

547
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,853
Come for this? The heart?

548
00:42:06,893 --> 00:42:08,996
You mean this heart right here?

549
00:42:09,012 --> 00:42:10,695
COME AND GET IT!

550
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:12,140
You are gonna get us killed!

551
00:42:12,187 --> 00:42:16,578
No, i'm gonna get us to Te Fiti.
So you can put it back. Thank you.

552
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,852
"You're welcome!"

553
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:24,322
Kakamora!

554
00:42:24,346 --> 00:42:25,394
Kaka... what?

555
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,115
Murdering little pirates!

556
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:31,241
Wonder what they're here for.

557
00:42:35,496 --> 00:42:38,042
They're kind of cute.

558
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:45,815
T H I S S U B T R A N S C R I P T E D BY
^~ P e n n y H a m a d a ~^

559
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:58,133
Ocean? Do something!
Help us!

560
00:42:58,156 --> 00:43:00,711
The ocean doesn't help you.
You help yourself.

561
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:05,670
You can't sail?

562
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,051
I... uh...

563
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:08,967
I am self-thought.

564
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,750
Whoa!

565
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:22,413
Can you shapeshift of something?

566
00:43:22,437 --> 00:43:25,922
You see my hook?
No magic hook, no magic powers.

567
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:53,458
Their boat is starting into part boats!

568
00:44:12,812 --> 00:44:14,939
Yup! I just did that.

569
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:21,983
No! No! No!

570
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:24,094
HeiHei!

571
00:44:38,278 --> 00:44:39,278
Maui!

572
00:44:39,563 --> 00:44:40,897
They took the heart!

573
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,308
- That's the chicken.
- The heart is in it! UURRGGHH!

574
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:48,211
We have to get 'em back!

575
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:53,809
Maui!

576
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:10,412
There! Right there!

577
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,775
You turning?
What are you doing?

578
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:14,252
Uhh... escaping?

579
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:17,308
- The heart!
- Forget it! You'll never get her back!

580
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:19,568
Besides, we've got a better one.

581
00:45:19,768 --> 00:45:22,053
Hey! What did i gonna sail with?

582
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:24,735
They're just gonna kill ya!

583
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:29,839
Coconuts.

584
00:46:12,238 --> 00:46:13,372
Huh! Got it!

585
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:38,562
We did it!

586
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:42,864
Congratulations on peeing that curly.
You suprised me!

587
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,033
But i'm still not taking that thing back.

588
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:49,792
You wanna get to Te Fiti?
You gonna go through whole ocean

589
00:46:50,094 --> 00:46:54,463
Not to mention Te Ka!
The Lava Monster.

590
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:56,476
Ever defeat The Lava Monster?

591
00:46:56,943 --> 00:46:57,943
No...

592
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,490
...Have you?

593
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:10,365
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some... immortal.

594
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:15,669
You can't restore the heart without me.
And me says "no".

595
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:20,150
I'm getting my hook.
End the discussion.

596
00:47:26,516 --> 00:47:28,803
You'd be a hero.

597
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:33,905
- That's what you all about, right?
- Little girl...

598
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:37,397
- ...I am a hero.
- Maybe you were...

599
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,849
But now you're just a guy who
stole the heart of Te Fiti.

600
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:44,112
The guy who cursed the world.

601
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,210
You're no one's hero.

602
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:48,826
No one?

603
00:47:58,437 --> 00:47:59,437
But...

604
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:06,440
Put this back, save the world
You'd be everyone's hero.

605
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:13,923
Maui! Maui!
Maui!

606
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:15,757
He's so amazing!

607
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,924
We'll never make it without my hook.
Not pass Te Ka.

608
00:48:18,972 --> 00:48:20,313
Then we'll get your hook.

609
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:24,102
We get your hook, take out Te Ka,
restore the heart.

610
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:26,503
Unless you don't wanna be...

611
00:48:26,813 --> 00:48:27,813
...Maui?

612
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:30,083
Demigod of the wind and sea.

613
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,452
Hero to... all?

614
00:48:36,932 --> 00:48:40,311
- First, we get my hook.
- Then save the world!

615
00:48:40,845 --> 00:48:41,861
Deal?

616
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:42,869
Deal!

617
00:48:47,226 --> 00:48:48,226
Worth the shoot.

618
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:53,660
Okay, we go east,
to the layer of Tamatoa.

619
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,961
If anyone has my hook,
is that Bitty Eye Bottom Feeder.

620
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:12,522
Teach me to sail!

621
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:18,382
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

622
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,690
I should...

623
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:25,271
- I should be sailing.
- It's called "Way Finding", princess.

624
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:30,400
And such as sails and nuts.
It seeing where you going in your mind.

625
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:34,397
Knowing where you are
by knowing where you been.

626
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:37,143
Okay, first, i'm not a princess.

627
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,079
- I'm the daughter of the chief.
- Same difference.

628
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:40,872
- No!
- If you're well dressed...

629
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:42,666
...And you've an animal side kick.

630
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:43,781
You're a princess!

631
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:46,992
You're not a way finder,
You'll never be a way finder...

632
00:49:47,055 --> 00:49:48,801
You'll never be a way...

633
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:56,586
Really?

634
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:04,530
You are a bad person.

635
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:08,465
If you can talk, you can teach.
Way finding. Uhh...

636
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:10,736
Lesson one, hit it!

637
00:50:13,117 --> 00:50:14,291
Hold the sheets.

638
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:16,105
Not, the sheets!

639
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:17,713
No!

640
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:18,855
Nope!

641
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:21,268
Nope! No!

642
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:24,086
Tryed that one already.

643
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:30,973
You measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high five.

644
00:50:32,348 --> 00:50:35,000
If the currents warm,
you're going the right way.

645
00:50:37,261 --> 00:50:38,261
It's cold.

646
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:40,736
Wait! It's getting warmer.

647
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:44,210
Argh! That's disgusting!

648
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,933
What's wrong with you?!

649
00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:03,402
We're here?

650
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:06,338
See? Told you i can do it!

651
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:16,427
Matunui?

652
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:18,832
I'm home?

653
00:51:22,752 --> 00:51:23,752
Moana!

654
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:24,863
Dad?

655
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,141
Moana!

656
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,292
Mom?

657
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:30,918
Help!

658
00:51:32,831 --> 00:51:33,831
No!

659
00:51:34,149 --> 00:51:35,149
Moana!

660
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,731
Enjoy your beauty rest?

661
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,863
You know, a real way finder
never sleeps.

662
00:51:42,912 --> 00:51:45,673
So, they're actualy get where
they need to go.

663
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:49,507
Bustle up, butter cop!
We're here.

664
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:53,665
You sure these guys
gonna have your hook?

665
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:56,015
Tamatoa all he have it.

666
00:51:56,277 --> 00:51:59,760
He's a scavenger, collect stuff,
things he think it looks cool.

667
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:06,676
And for Tamatoa, trust me.
My hook is the coolest collective.

668
00:52:06,762 --> 00:52:09,120
And he leaves up... there?

669
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:15,332
No, that's just the entrance.
To umm...

670
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:17,976
- Realm of Monsters.
- Realm of Monsters?

671
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,572
Realm of Monsters?

672
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:22,405
We're going to Realm of Monsters?

673
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,095
We? No! Me!

674
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,492
You're gonna stay here
with the other chicken. Backya!

675
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:32,373
That's what i'm talkin' about.
Gimme some!

676
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:35,746
Come on! That was a good one!
How'd you not get it?

677
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,921
I called her a chicken.
There's a chicken on the boat.

678
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:41,425
I know she's human. But that's not a...
You know what? Forget it!

679
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:43,230
I'm not explaining it to you.

680
00:52:43,278 --> 00:52:45,207
'Cause that is not funny.

681
00:52:58,648 --> 00:53:02,537
So, daughter of the chief.
I thought you stayed in the village.

682
00:53:02,585 --> 00:53:04,490
You know, kiss some babies and things.

683
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:09,458
Hey, i'm just tryin' to understand
why your people decided to send...

684
00:53:09,505 --> 00:53:12,045
...A horrible princess.
You!

685
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:15,348
My people? Didn't send me.

686
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:16,704
The ocean did.

687
00:53:17,022 --> 00:53:19,069
The ocean? Make sense!

688
00:53:19,244 --> 00:53:22,643
Your what? Age? Can't sail?
Obvious choice.

689
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,088
It choose me, for a reason.

690
00:53:26,276 --> 00:53:30,493
If the ocean so smart, why didn't he
just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself?

691
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:32,442
Or bring me my hook?

692
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,818
The ocean stride up, cookie dukes!

693
00:53:36,355 --> 00:53:38,475
But i'm sure it's not wrong about you.

694
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:41,116
You're the choosen one!

695
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:51,286
ThisSub100 %TranscriptedBy
^~P.e.n.n.y~H.a.m.a.d.a~^

696
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:59,770
The ocean choose you for a reason.

697
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:03,236
If you start singing,
i'm gonna throw up.

698
00:54:03,683 --> 00:54:05,838
So, let's sing at entrance.

699
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,461
Yes, because it only apears
after a human sacrifice.

700
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,042
Kidding! Haha! So serious!

701
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:30,505
*~ReadingSomeMagicFormula~*

702
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:41,872
Don't worry, it's a lot far
there down than looks.

703
00:54:48,436 --> 00:54:51,372
I'm still falling!

704
00:54:55,578 --> 00:54:56,688
Go!

705
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:21,046
And he sticks the landing.
Huh?

706
00:55:22,157 --> 00:55:24,871
What? Dumb, dumb,
she's not even here.

707
00:55:24,919 --> 00:55:27,625
No immortals gonna
jump into the realm of...

708
00:55:32,977 --> 00:55:33,977
Well...

709
00:55:33,986 --> 00:55:34,986
She's dead.

710
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:37,413
Okay! Let's get my hook!

711
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:49,397
Ew... Ew... Ew...

712
00:56:38,497 --> 00:56:40,764
Maui's fish hook.

713
00:56:40,807 --> 00:56:41,807
Yeeeaaahhh...

714
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:46,711
Sorry... i thought you're a monster.
What? I found your hook and...

715
00:56:46,744 --> 00:56:48,910
...You were right this time
i fool i really like the dis...

716
00:56:48,935 --> 00:56:51,886
- Stay!
- What? No! I'm the one who...

717
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:56,602
Listen, for thousand years i've only
thinking to keep this hair sooky...

718
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:59,258
...Getting my hook
and being awesome again.

719
00:56:59,379 --> 00:57:02,887
And it's not getting screwed up
by immortal who has no business...

720
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:05,666
...Inside of a monster cave.
Except...

721
00:57:07,602 --> 00:57:10,244
Except...
You made us beat.

722
00:57:12,522 --> 00:57:15,664
Wow... shiny glittering cave.

723
00:57:15,681 --> 00:57:19,919
And just like me it is covered
in sparkly treasure.

724
00:57:19,998 --> 00:57:22,324
Sparkle... Sparkle... Sparkle...

725
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:24,418
- You're not sail at it!
- This is stupid!

726
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:27,632
- I'm just gonna walk up and get it.
- You go up there, he will kill you.

727
00:57:27,728 --> 00:57:29,261
Just stick to the plan.

728
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:32,831
Oh, when he shows up
keep him distracted.

729
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:36,751
Make him talk about himself.
He loves breaking about how grave he is.

730
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,950
You do it to us get along
as well.

731
00:57:38,982 --> 00:57:41,315
You're right in the top of his leg.

732
00:57:43,387 --> 00:57:44,387
Maui?

733
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:55,929
Hohoho...
What do have we here?

734
00:57:55,995 --> 00:57:58,765
It's a sparkly... shinny...

735
00:57:58,844 --> 00:58:00,712
Wait a minute...

736
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:04,685
It's a human!
What are you doing down here?

737
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:06,783
In the Realm of the Mons...

738
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:09,387
Just pick an eye, babe.
I can't... I can't consentrate...

739
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:12,870
...On what i'm sayin' if you keep...
Yup! Pick one! Pick One!

740
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:15,529
You're a funny looking
little thing, aren't you?

741
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:18,132
- Don't! That's my grandma's!
- "That's my grandma's..."

742
00:58:18,148 --> 00:58:22,331
I ate my grandma! And it took a weak
'cause you was absolutely human just...

743
00:58:22,355 --> 00:58:23,806
Why are you here?

744
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,536
'Cause you're amazing!

745
00:58:26,717 --> 00:58:30,764
And we immortals have heard
of a tale of the crab...

746
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:34,209
...Who became a legend!
And i had to know...

747
00:58:34,225 --> 00:58:37,709
How... you... became... so...

748
00:58:37,757 --> 00:58:40,733
...Crab?
Clueless...

749
00:58:40,828 --> 00:58:45,259
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

750
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:47,924
Because if you are...

751
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:50,138
...I will gladly do so!

752
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,646
In song form!

753
00:58:54,939 --> 00:58:58,518
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam

754
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,455
I was a drab little crab once

755
00:59:01,535 --> 00:59:04,969
Now I know I can be happy as a clam

756
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:07,844
Because I'm beautiful, baby

757
00:59:08,114 --> 00:59:11,694
Did your granny say
"Listen to your heart...

758
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:14,733
...Be who you are on the inside"?

759
00:59:14,892 --> 00:59:18,025
I need three words to tear
her argument apart

760
00:59:18,114 --> 00:59:20,384
Your granny lied!
I'd rather be...

761
00:59:20,392 --> 00:59:21,622
Shiny

762
00:59:21,638 --> 00:59:24,558
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck

763
00:59:24,598 --> 00:59:26,865
Scrub the deck and make it look...

764
00:59:26,892 --> 00:59:28,210
Shiny

765
00:59:28,225 --> 00:59:31,161
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck

766
00:59:31,432 --> 00:59:32,432
Just a sec!

767
00:59:32,487 --> 00:59:34,011
Don't you know

768
00:59:34,027 --> 00:59:35,574
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb

769
00:59:35,598 --> 00:59:37,798
They chase anything that glitters

770
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:39,312
Beginners!

771
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:42,177
Oh, and here they come, come, come

772
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,582
To the brightest thing that glitters

773
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:45,820
Mmm, fish dinners

774
00:59:45,828 --> 00:59:48,576
I just love free food

775
00:59:48,615 --> 00:59:51,964
And you look like seafood

776
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,837
No!

777
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:54,901
Hey! Crab cake!

778
00:59:58,401 --> 01:00:00,599
I'm back! Mmuah!

779
01:00:01,282 --> 01:00:03,432
It's Maui time!

780
01:00:05,988 --> 01:00:07,639
What do you say, little buddy?

781
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,139
Giant hawk? Comin' up!

782
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:17,079
^^~WAIT! THAT'S KRISTOFF!~^^
(from Frozen)

783
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:27,135
Well, well, well,
Little Maui having a trouble with his look.

784
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,390
You little semi-demi-mini-god

785
01:00:29,977 --> 01:00:32,366
Ouch! What a terrible performance

786
01:00:32,374 --> 01:00:33,906
Get the hook
Get it?

787
01:00:33,938 --> 01:00:36,850
You don't swing it like you used to, man

788
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:40,455
Yet I have to give you credit for my start

789
01:00:40,477 --> 01:00:43,612
And your tattoos on the outside

790
01:00:43,676 --> 01:00:46,997
For just like you I made myself
a work of art

791
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:49,175
I'll never hide
I can't, I'm too...

792
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,414
Shiny

793
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,438
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough

794
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,739
Strut my stuff
My stuff is so...

795
01:00:55,763 --> 01:00:57,101
Shiny

796
01:00:57,149 --> 01:00:59,879
Send your armies but
they'll never be enough

797
01:00:59,911 --> 01:01:01,363
My shell's too tough

798
01:01:01,395 --> 01:01:04,506
Maui man, you could try, try, try

799
01:01:04,538 --> 01:01:06,807
But you can't expect a demi-god

800
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:09,173
To beat a decapod
Give it up

801
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:11,125
You will die, die, die

802
01:01:11,173 --> 01:01:13,521
Now it's time for me to take apart

803
01:01:13,593 --> 01:01:15,293
Your aching heart

804
01:01:15,453 --> 01:01:20,460
Far from the ones who abandoned you

805
01:01:20,492 --> 01:01:25,090
Chasing the love of these humans

806
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,154
Who made you feel wanted

807
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:31,082
You tried to be tough

808
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:35,222
But your armour's just not hard enough

809
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:36,461
Maui

810
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,426
Now it's time to kick your...

811
01:01:38,476 --> 01:01:39,778
Hiney

812
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:41,646
Ever seen someone so...

813
01:01:41,678 --> 01:01:43,004
Shiny

814
01:01:43,043 --> 01:01:46,162
Soak it in 'cause it's the last
you'll ever see

815
01:01:46,186 --> 01:01:47,884
C'est la vie mon ami

816
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,607
I'm so shinny

817
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,844
Now I'll eat you
So prepare your final plea

818
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:54,750
Just for me

819
01:01:54,773 --> 01:01:56,573
You'll never be quite as...

820
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:58,107
Shiny

821
01:01:58,138 --> 01:02:00,154
You wish you were nice and...

822
01:02:00,186 --> 01:02:04,686
Shiny

823
01:02:04,726 --> 01:02:06,162
- Hey!
- Huh?

824
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:08,688
I've got something shinny for ya!

825
01:02:10,384 --> 01:02:15,082
The Heart of Te Fiti.
You can't run from me!

826
01:02:15,345 --> 01:02:17,945
Oh, you can't.
You can't suprising me!

827
01:02:19,805 --> 01:02:22,709
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

828
01:02:26,964 --> 01:02:30,371
The power of creation
for the frustation!

829
01:02:30,776 --> 01:02:32,509
Where is it?
Where is it?

830
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:34,553
We gotta go!

831
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:37,466
- What about the heart?
- He can have it.

832
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:38,911
I've got a better one.

833
01:02:40,315 --> 01:02:41,640
Yes! I have the...

834
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:43,101
Wait a minute... Argh!

835
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:47,402
I see she's takin' a bonicle
and she's covered it biolumination-elgy.

836
01:02:47,442 --> 01:02:48,823
Has a division!

837
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:52,531
Come back here!

838
01:02:59,293 --> 01:03:01,155
Hey! Heeey!

839
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:03,361
Did you like the song?

840
01:03:10,694 --> 01:03:13,590
We're alive!
We're ali.... huh?

841
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:19,096
Listen, i appreciate
what you did down there...

842
01:03:19,392 --> 01:03:20,844
- ...Took guts...
- Mmhmm.

843
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,519
But, uh... I'm sorry i'm tryin'
be some seer for once...

844
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,538
- ...And it feels like you're distracted.
- No! No! No way!

845
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:31,289
Really? 'Cause you lookin' at me
like i have a... huh...

846
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:34,869
Shark head.

847
01:03:36,698 --> 01:03:40,312
- Do you have a shark head? 'Coz you...
- Look, the point is...

848
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,285
...For a little girl... child...
thing whatever...

849
01:03:43,325 --> 01:03:46,008
Who had no business being down there...

850
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:47,425
You did me a solid.

851
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:49,896
But you also almost died.

852
01:03:50,016 --> 01:03:54,571
And i couldn't even beat the dumb crab.
So chances of beating Te Ka...

853
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:59,224
We'll never make it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

854
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:01,065
It's not cursed.

855
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:05,171
- Sharkhead.
- It is not cursed.

856
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:20,518
Cursed.

857
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:28,886
What can i say except,
"We're dead soon..."

858
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:31,055
We're dead soon...

859
01:04:31,545 --> 01:04:33,560
Can you at least... try?

860
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:37,774
Giant hawk!

861
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:43,529
Hey! It's okay! It's okay!
We're dead soon...

862
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:46,339
Alright, break time's over.
Get up!

863
01:04:46,688 --> 01:04:48,958
Why? You gonna get me a speech?

864
01:04:49,267 --> 01:04:53,220
Tell me i could beat Te Ka
'coz i'm... Maui?

865
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:56,124
Take a high, tiny.

866
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,716
How do you get your tatoos?

867
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:07,292
They showed up,
When i earn 'em.

868
01:05:08,006 --> 01:05:10,672
How do you earn that one?
What's that for?

869
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:14,212
That's uhh... Men's discovery of Nania.

870
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:17,427
- What's Nania?
- None of your business.

871
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:20,268
I'll just keep asking.

872
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:23,741
What's it for?

873
01:05:24,082 --> 01:05:25,949
You need to stop doing that.

874
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:32,317
- Back off!
- Just tell me what it is!

875
01:05:32,325 --> 01:05:35,761
- I said back off!
- Is it why your hook's not working?

876
01:05:52,034 --> 01:05:53,486
You don't wanna talk...

877
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:54,589
Don't talk.

878
01:05:55,153 --> 01:05:57,288
You wanna throw me off the boat...

879
01:05:57,502 --> 01:05:58,732
Throw me off.

880
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:02,732
You wanna tell me,
i don't know what i'm doing...

881
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:04,767
I know i don't.

882
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:08,727
I have no idea why the ocean choose me.

883
01:06:09,172 --> 01:06:10,172
You're right...

884
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:15,094
But, my island... is dying.

885
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:18,879
So i am here.

886
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:24,591
It's just me and you,
and i want to help.

887
01:06:25,324 --> 01:06:29,550
But i can't... If...
You don't let me.

888
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,352
I wasn't born...

889
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,693
...A demigod.

890
01:06:38,106 --> 01:06:39,876
I had human parents.

891
01:06:40,924 --> 01:06:45,963
They uhh... They take one look
and decided...

892
01:06:46,813 --> 01:06:49,427
They did not want me.

893
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:54,122
They threw me into the sea.
Like i was...

894
01:06:54,202 --> 01:06:55,543
...Nothing.

895
01:06:56,916 --> 01:07:00,064
Somehow, i was found by the gods.

896
01:07:00,376 --> 01:07:04,185
They gave me the hook.
They made me...

897
01:07:04,638 --> 01:07:06,663
...Maui.

898
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:09,455
And... back to the humans i went.

899
01:07:10,289 --> 01:07:13,863
I gave them island, fire, coconuts.

900
01:07:15,127 --> 01:07:17,063
Anything that everyone want.

901
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,611
You took the heart for them.

902
01:07:21,175 --> 01:07:24,143
You did everything for them.

903
01:07:24,818 --> 01:07:26,135
So they loved you.

904
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:30,195
It was... never enough.

905
01:07:38,614 --> 01:07:41,447
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

906
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:45,003
Maybe the ocean brought you to them.

907
01:07:45,305 --> 01:07:49,051
Because it's someone who
is worthy of being saved.

908
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:53,882
But the gods aren't the one
who made you Maui.

909
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,249
You are.

910
01:08:05,662 --> 01:08:10,400
Okay... Okay... Hey...
I love you too, buddy.

911
01:08:24,707 --> 01:08:28,144
<i>Do you remember when we did all that?</i>

912
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:31,429
<i>The sway, the energy
expressed in the dance.</i>

913
01:08:31,882 --> 01:08:35,342
<i>Come on, let's go
Give me your hand</i>

914
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:38,715
<i>Come on, let's go
Come let's dance</i>

915
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:42,287
<i>Come on, let's go
Give me your hand</i>

916
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:45,580
<i>Come on, let's go
You are the only one that I wish for</i>

917
01:08:45,596 --> 01:08:49,215
<i>Round and round spinning round
Hey, my head's getting dizzy</i>

918
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:52,627
<i>Round and round spinning round
Do it again it'll soon clear</i>

919
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:55,763
<i>Smile my way
My way</i>

920
01:08:55,787 --> 01:08:57,675
<i>Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing</i>

921
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,463
<i>Listen to the pate
Aue</i>

922
01:08:59,493 --> 01:09:02,525
<i>Smile my way
My way</i>

923
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:04,643
<i>Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing</i>

924
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:06,659
<i>Listen to the pate
Aue</i>

925
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:16,632
<i>Listen to pate
Listen to pate</i>

926
01:09:17,306 --> 01:09:20,552
<i>Keep on dancing
Listen to pate</i>

927
01:09:42,049 --> 01:09:44,798
Next stop... Te Fiti.

928
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,942
<i>Smile my way
My way</i>

929
01:09:50,963 --> 01:09:53,400
<i>Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing</i>

930
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:55,167
<i>Listen to the pate
Aue</i>

931
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:58,087
<i>Smile my way
My way</i>

932
01:09:58,122 --> 01:10:00,559
<i>Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing</i>

933
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:01,876
<i>Listen to the pate
Aue</i>

934
01:10:31,536 --> 01:10:33,877
- What?
- I figure it out.

935
01:10:35,512 --> 01:10:39,215
You know the ocean used to love
when i pulled up islands.

936
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:42,654
'Cause your ancestors would say
resease... find them.

937
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,813
All those new lands, new villages...

938
01:10:47,195 --> 01:10:50,059
...It was the water
that connected them all.

939
01:10:50,084 --> 01:10:53,797
In the bioworthy ocean,
i think i'd be looking for uhh...

940
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,536
...Curly haired, non-princess...

941
01:10:56,624 --> 01:10:58,157
...To start that again.

942
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:03,594
That is literary nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

943
01:11:03,989 --> 01:11:06,369
Probably you should've said
that to Te Fiti.

944
01:11:07,767 --> 01:11:08,767
I did.

945
01:11:11,818 --> 01:11:19,429
Moana of Matunui, i believe you have
officially delivered Maui across the great sea.

946
01:11:20,893 --> 01:11:23,671
Moana! Moana! Moana!

947
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:25,579
She's so amazing!

948
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:28,354
It's time.

949
01:11:46,654 --> 01:11:48,241
Go save the world!

950
01:12:11,655 --> 01:12:12,655
Maui!

951
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,519
- What you... What are you doing?
- Finding your better way in.

952
01:12:52,264 --> 01:12:54,185
- We won't make it!
- Yes we will!

953
01:12:54,248 --> 01:12:55,470
- Turn around!
- No!

954
01:12:55,494 --> 01:12:57,375
- Moana stop!
- No!

955
01:13:25,754 --> 01:13:27,267
Are you okay?

956
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,238
Maui?

957
01:13:37,854 --> 01:13:39,654
I've told you to turn back.

958
01:13:42,013 --> 01:13:43,764
I thought we could make it.

959
01:13:44,179 --> 01:13:45,179
We?

960
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:48,599
I thought... I could make it.

961
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:53,847
- We can fix it!
- It was made by the gods.

962
01:13:54,046 --> 01:13:56,101
You can't fix it!

963
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,632
Next time we'll be more careful.

964
01:13:58,895 --> 01:14:03,415
Te Ka was stucked on barrier islands.
It Lava, it can't go on the water.

965
01:14:03,546 --> 01:14:05,212
We can find a way around.

966
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,356
I'm not going back.

967
01:14:07,959 --> 01:14:10,451
We... We still have to restore the heart.

968
01:14:10,753 --> 01:14:13,893
My hook is cracked.
One more hit and it's over.

969
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:16,070
Maui, you have to restore the heart!

970
01:14:16,102 --> 01:14:18,246
Without my hook, i am nothing.

971
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:19,367
That's not true!

972
01:14:19,404 --> 01:14:22,174
WITHOUT MY HOOK, I AM NOTHING!

973
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:35,976
We're only here because
you stole the heart in the first place.

974
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:41,794
No, we're here because the ocean
told you "You're special" and you believed it.

975
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:47,292
I am Moana of Matunui,
You will board my boat...

976
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:48,098
Goodbye, Moana.

977
01:14:48,098 --> 01:14:51,207
- Sail across the sea...
- I'm not killing myself so you could...

978
01:14:51,232 --> 01:14:54,263
- ...Prove your something you not!
- ...And restore The Heart of Te Fiti.

979
01:14:54,288 --> 01:14:56,613
The ocean choose me!

980
01:14:57,613 --> 01:14:59,105
He choose wrong.

981
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:10,067
Maui!

982
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,192
Why did you bring me here?

983
01:15:32,398 --> 01:15:34,747
I'm not the right person.

984
01:15:36,874 --> 01:15:40,176
You have to choose someone else.

985
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,750
Choose someone else!

986
01:15:45,562 --> 01:15:46,919
Please...

987
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:26,082
You're a long way pass the reef.

988
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:28,105
Grandma?

989
01:16:29,987 --> 01:16:32,868
Guess i choose the right tattoo.

990
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:34,527
Grandma!

991
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:41,883
I'm trying, grandma.

992
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:43,138
I...

993
01:16:44,027 --> 01:16:45,773
I couldn't do it.

994
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,313
It's not your fault.

995
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:52,607
I never should've put so
much on your shoulders.

996
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:55,631
If you are ready to go home...

997
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:59,651
...I'll be with you.

998
01:17:15,723 --> 01:17:17,316
Why do you hasn't named?

999
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,304
I don't know.

1000
01:17:23,975 --> 01:17:26,842
I know a girl from an island

1001
01:17:27,285 --> 01:17:29,874
She stands apart from the crowd

1002
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:33,347
She loves the sea and her people

1003
01:17:33,648 --> 01:17:36,608
She makes her whole family proud

1004
01:17:37,188 --> 01:17:40,371
Sometimes the world seems against you

1005
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:43,430
The journey may leave a scar

1006
01:17:43,588 --> 01:17:46,445
But scars can heal and reveal just

1007
01:17:46,501 --> 01:17:49,794
Where you are

1008
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:53,029
The people you love will change you

1009
01:17:53,394 --> 01:17:56,194
The things you have learned will guide you

1010
01:17:56,592 --> 01:17:59,910
And nothing on Earth can silence

1011
01:17:59,997 --> 01:18:03,187
The quiet voice still inside you

1012
01:18:03,354 --> 01:18:06,687
And when that voice starts to whisper

1013
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:10,204
Moana, you've come so far

1014
01:18:10,244 --> 01:18:12,132
Moana, listen

1015
01:18:12,212 --> 01:18:18,370
Do you know who you are?

1016
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:21,116
Who am I?

1017
01:18:22,632 --> 01:18:26,172
I am the girl who loves my island

1018
01:18:26,219 --> 01:18:29,681
I'm the girl who loves the sea

1019
01:18:30,565 --> 01:18:33,941
It calls me

1020
01:18:35,572 --> 01:18:38,870
I am the daughter of the village chief

1021
01:18:38,974 --> 01:18:42,117
We are descended from voyagers

1022
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:44,965
Who found their way across the world

1023
01:18:45,077 --> 01:18:47,930
They call me

1024
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,728
I've delivered us to where we are

1025
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:54,672
I have journeyed farther

1026
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,624
I am everything I've learned and more

1027
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:01,087
Still it calls me

1028
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:04,174
And the call isn't out there at all

1029
01:19:04,214 --> 01:19:07,249
It's inside me

1030
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:14,254
It's like the tide
always falling and rising

1031
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,745
I will carry you here in my heart

1032
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:20,110
You'll remind me

1033
01:19:20,142 --> 01:19:26,142
That come what may, I know the way

1034
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:30,810
I am Moana!

1035
01:19:30,823 --> 01:19:31,018

I'll board my boat
I will sail across the sea

1105
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:16,089
And restore The Heart Of Te Fiti.

1106
01:20:52,228 --> 01:20:54,694
Te Ka can't follow us into the water.

1107
01:20:54,894 --> 01:20:58,845
We make it pass to the barrier island.
We make it to Te Fiti.

1108
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,647
None of you will understand.
Because you're a chicken.

1109
01:22:09,052 --> 01:22:10,052
No!

1110
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:12,010
HeiHei!

1111
01:22:12,026 --> 01:22:13,597
No! No! No! No! No!

1112
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,097
Nice thwack!

1113
01:22:26,065 --> 01:22:27,065
Te Fiti!

But your hook...

1117
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:06,086
One more hit and...

1118
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,573
Te Ka's gonna catch me first.

1119
01:23:11,147 --> 01:23:13,663
Hey, i got your back, the choosen one!

1120
01:23:13,798 --> 01:23:14,998
Go save the world!

1121
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:16,203
Maui...

1122
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,026
Thank you.

1123
01:23:18,655 --> 01:23:20,183
You're welcome.

1124
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,573
Hot! Hot! Hot!

1125
01:23:53,592 --> 01:23:54,592
Hey, Te Ka!

1126
01:23:56,075 --> 01:23:57,075
Shark head!

1127
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:10,730
Moana!

1128
01:24:20,726 --> 01:24:22,975
Get the high to the spiral!

1129
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:02,141
Te Fiti...

1130
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:04,756
It's gone.

1131
01:25:17,308 --> 01:25:19,610
TE KA!

1132
01:25:54,943 --> 01:25:56,209
Let her come to me.

1133
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:19,238
~ <i>Ou mata e matagi</i> ~

1134
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:23,849
I have crossed the horizon to find you

1135
01:26:24,415 --> 01:26:29,804
~ <i>Ou loto mamaina toa</i> ~

1136
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:33,208
I know your name

1137
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,303
~ <i>Manatu atu</i> ~

1138
01:26:36,407 --> 01:26:40,899
I may have stolen the heart from inside you

1139
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:48,485
But this does not define you

1140
01:26:48,562 --> 01:26:51,350
~ <i>Manatu atu</i> ~

1141
01:26:51,395 --> 01:26:56,568
This is not who you are

1142
01:26:57,155 --> 01:27:04,383
You know who you are

1143
01:27:09,397 --> 01:27:11,721
Who you truly are.

1144
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,614
Te Fiti.

1145
01:28:16,566 --> 01:28:18,185
The chicken whips.

1146
01:28:19,947 --> 01:28:21,843
I'm sorry about your hook.

1147
01:28:22,336 --> 01:28:25,514
Well... Hook. No hook.

1148
01:28:25,955 --> 01:28:27,161
I'm Maui.

1149
01:28:46,312 --> 01:28:51,530
Te Fiti! Haha!
How have you been?

1150
01:28:54,408 --> 01:28:58,364
Look, what i did was... wrong.

1151
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,527
I have no excuse.

1152
01:29:01,273 --> 01:29:02,273
I'm sorry.

1153
01:29:11,261 --> 01:29:14,467
You know, it'd be rude
if it's a gift from a gods.

1154
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:23,563
Thank you. Your kindness
is deeply pleasured.

1155
01:29:24,796 --> 01:29:28,542
~ <i>Sei e va'ai mai</i> ~
Look down...

1156
01:29:29,082 --> 01:29:32,653
~ <i>I le tātou lalolagi</i> ~
Upon our world

1157
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,963
~ <i>Sei e mālamalama</i> ~
The light

1158
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,765
~ <i>E lelei ma le mānaia</i> ~
It is good and beautiful

1159
01:29:40,797 --> 01:29:44,027
~ <i>Sei e va'ai mai</i> ~
Look down...

1160
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:47,858
~ <i>Mānaia o le tātou ōlaga.</i> ~
At how beautiful our lives are.

1161
01:30:13,301 --> 01:30:16,243
- Got a mission, drum stick.
- You can come with us, you know.

1162
01:30:16,706 --> 01:30:20,682
My people are going to need
a... Master Way Finder.

1163
01:30:21,889 --> 01:30:23,436
They already have one.

1164
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:43,746
See you out there, Maui.

1165
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,548
See you out there, Moana.

1166
01:31:39,808 --> 01:31:42,944
- Mom! Dad!
- Moana!

1167
01:31:50,684 --> 01:31:55,021
I may have gone a little way
pass the reef.

1168
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:58,318
It suits you.

1169
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:02,113
- She's back! Moana!
- Pua!

1170
01:32:06,704 --> 01:32:08,405
Welcome home!

Pardon us...

1178
01:32:55,622 --> 01:33:00,392
Aue, aue
We set a course to find

1179
01:33:00,447 --> 01:33:05,109
A brand new island everywere we roam

1180
01:33:05,225 --> 01:33:09,933
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind

1181
01:33:09,989 --> 01:33:12,055
And when it's time to find home

1182
01:33:12,362 --> 01:33:14,743
We know the way

1183
01:33:14,774 --> 01:33:19,314
Aue, aue
We are explorers reading every sign

1184
01:33:19,417 --> 01:33:22,219
We tell the stories of our elders

1185
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:24,378
In a never-ending chain

1186
01:33:24,425 --> 01:33:28,885
~ <i>Aue, aue</i> ~
~ <i>Te fenua, te malie</i> ~

1187
01:33:28,965 --> 01:33:31,354
~ <i>Na heko hakilia</i> ~

1188
01:33:31,409 --> 01:33:37,284
We know the way

1189
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:44,502
^^ Thanks for using this subtitle! ^^
