00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,399
one winner.
Forty two losers

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,983
I eat losers for breakfast

6
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:56,640

7
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:58,260
Yes sir... you did

8
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:00,934

that all the time

9
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,401

10
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:04,870

you to be lonely

11
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:09,278
well, thank you but
I'm kind of preparing for a race

12
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,547
I need a little quiet

13
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,177
all right.
You got it buddy

14
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:20,512
hey every buddy, listen up. My best friend
Lightning McQueen need quiet. Perfect quiet.

15
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:24,007
Okay, where was I

16
00:01:26,148 --> 00:01:28,461
racing. Real racing

17
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:33,322
that ain't racin
that wasn't even a Sunday Drive

18
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,921
that was one lap
racing is 500 of those

19
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:38,939
everybody fighting to
move up lap after lap

20
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:41,864
inside outside inches
apart never touching

21
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:43,670
now that's racing

22
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:47,766
well, I can't argue
with a Doc Hudson

23
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,739
how true. How true

24
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,939
hey lightning. Are you ready? Oh yeah

focus racing against Bobby and Cal

42
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:38,659

43
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,376
these guys are real class ass

44
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:43,539

00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,375
I am the flame

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,544
big tax how's my
favorite competitor

56

just say the word, I'll put call off the donico team
and replace him with you

57

00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:47,814

61
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,547
roll it buddy

62
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:54,566
and meet buddy too

63
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:02,330
another great physician
of 80s. McQueen and Swift nose-to-nose

64
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:04,312
how's the view back there Boby

65
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:06,890
well, you would better not bleep
or, I'll blow right past you

66
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:10,615
the flap is out it's the final
stretch McQueen in the lead

67
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,363
okay lets
see what you get

68
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,888
oh, it's Jackson storm for the win

69
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:30,057
a huge upset.
Even lightning or Bobby never saw him coming

70
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:31,679
it's one thing to start

71
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,059
fast but we haven't seen anyone cross
the line with that kind of speed and power

72
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,680
its the young Lightning McQueen first
arrived on the scene

73
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:43,069
hey Bobby, who is that? That's....

74
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,125
Jackson storm
yeah he's one of the rookies

75
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,150
thank you, I appreciate it.
Thank you very much. Thank you

76
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:57,869
hey, Jackson storm right .great race today.

77
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,592
Wow, thank you mr. McQueen

78
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:02,964
you have no idea what a pleasure
it is for me to finally beat you

79
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:08,367
oh thanks wait hang on
did you say meet or beat.

80
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,319
I think you heard me

81
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,619
what... maqueen over here .storm,
can we get some pictures?

82
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,849
Yeah yeah, come on. Let's get a picture

83
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,266
you know what. You can
get a ton of pictures

84
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:20,023
because the champ here has been a
role model of mine for years now

85
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:22,289
and I mean a lot of years

86
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,339
right, I love this guy.

87
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,380
I think I touched a nerve

88
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:42,749
welcome back chick`s pics and Chick Hicks

89
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,362
I'm your host former and forever
Piston Cup champion chick hecks

90
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:49,289
this just in

91
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,309
rookie Jackson storm slaps the
proverbial door on lightning McQueen

92
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,207
oh, I couldn't have enjoyed it
more if I'd beaten McQueen myself

93
00:06:58,232 --> 00:06:59,242
oh, wait. I have

94
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:03,551
now enough about me. Here
to tell you how it happened

95
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:06,369
is professional number
cruncher miss Natalie certain

96
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:11,099
it is pleasure to be here chick and actually
I prefer the term statistical analyst

97
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,129
right, so who is this mysterious newcomer

98
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,369
Jackson storm and why is he so darn fast

99
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,085
it's no mystery if you
study the data mr. Hicks.

100
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,179
Jackson's storm is part of the
next generation of high-tech racers

101
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,102
unlike the veterans of yesterday

102
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:30,889
oh what, old-timers like this guy ha ha
right

103
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:34,429
storm achieves his top speeds
by exploiting the numbers

104
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,189
I refer of course
to racing data: Tire pressure, downforce

105
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,689
weight distribution, aerodynamics

106
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:43,597
and NextGen's like storm
are taking advantage

107
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,509
the racing world is changing

108
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,139
and for the better if it means my old
pal lightning is down for the count

109
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,220
am I right certain

110
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:52,565
well, if I'm certain
of anything chick

111
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,646
it's that this season
is about to get even more interesting

112
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,658
I'll tell you what down

113
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,938
Jackson storm has
certainly made an impact

114
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:04,329
we've got six more
next generation rookies in the field

115
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,999
with six veterans hired to clear
the way

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,600
goog mornin champ.
How's our living legend today

117
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:13,427
still very much a live, thank you.
Now, I would appreciate if

118
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:17,430
I can't believe I get to race the Lightning
McQueen in his farewell season

119
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,889
what are you talking about

120
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:21,779
what..the flag...
good luck out there champ

121
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:23,660
you are gonna need it

122
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,579
one reason storm and the
next gens are more efficient

123
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:37,633
their ability to hold the optimum
racing line every single lap

124
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:38,763
with number 3
for the rockey sansation

125
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:42,719
storms in a class of
his own and a big reason for that

126
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,281
training on the newest
cutting-edge simulators

127
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:48,683
these machines create a virtual
racing experience so real

128
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,791
racers
never even have to go outside

129
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:54,981
storms ability to hold that line
is like nothing we had ever see

130
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:56,905
four rows..are you kidding me

131
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,950
two percent lower drag
coefficient

132
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,063
I wanna finish

133
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:02,048
5% increase in downforce

134
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:03,491
lucky number seven

135
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:06,018
1.2 % high on top speed

136
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:07,454

137
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:12,386
Mr. cup winner Chick Hicks here with
the racer taking the circuit by storm

138
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,027
Jackson storm. Another easy win overall
catch ow

139
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:20,159
or should I say the boos
because he's always in the back. Am I right?

140
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,346
No, no, no, chick
McQueen is a crafty veteran champ

141
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:26,112
he's the elder statesman
of the sport you know

142
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:28,303
takes everything I
got to beat him

143
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,375
oh, you got kidding me

144
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:35,729
what changes are you gonna make
to get McQueen back on top

145
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,618
look... we try new trainee
method.. is he prepare to retire

146
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,200
guys let's not overreact it's
just a slump

147
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:42,539
we'll get him next week

148
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,159
okay that's enough

149
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,720
no comment

150
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:47,144
not even about cow
weathers retiring

151
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:47,766
wait what

152
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,059
cow weathers he's
hanging up his lightyears

153
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,593
no, no comment on that either

154
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,075
hey, Cal

155
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:05,409
hey, retirement
what's going on

156
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,993
you know, I asked my uncle once how I'd
know when it was time to stop

157
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:12,955
you know what he said

158
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:15,854
the youngsters will tell you

159
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,984
we had some good times together

160
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:25,833
I'm gonna miss that the most I think

161
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,242
yeah

162
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:37,001
more changes ahead check

163
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:41,742
every week we've seen veteran racers either
retire like Cow weathers tonight

164
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:47,379
or fired to make room for these younger
faster racers and it's not over yet

165
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,640
hello racers fans
welcome to the los anglos 500

166
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:55,331
the final race of the piston cup season.

167
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,730
I can do this

168
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,717
I raced for you guys
almost 10 years

169
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:01,209
sorry brick

170
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,013
my mind's made up

171
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,400
I'm giving your
number to someone new

172
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:05,829
at two wings last year

173
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,225
old sports

174
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,619
hey Bobby

175
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:11,328
do you know what's happening with brick...

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,504
you.. wait! You're not Bobby

177
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,207
my name is Danny bro

178
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,579
hey champ, where would all your friends go

179
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:38,523
the final check of his tires as storm
settles into the pole position

180
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,386
what we see in this season
was a great race

181
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,719
that's it Buddy

182
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:13,609
40 laps to go and race leader Jackson
storm is making his way on the pit road

183
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,189
with McQueen on his tail

184
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:17,779
a good stop
here could mean the difference between

185
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,050
victory and defeat

186
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:21,676
come on, come on, that's a
would be there. Come on

187
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,629
I want to get back there before he does

188
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:25,223
quito.... hurry up

189
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:29,106
what a bitch stop of macqueen

190
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:32,399
man, he just got the lead

191
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:34,423
can he hold on it

192
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,942
hey maqueen, are you alright

193
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,393
listen, don't you worry pal.

194
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:44,480
You had agood run

195
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,245
enjoy your retirement

196
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,858
storm takes back the lead

197
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:50,209
unbelievable! McQueen is fading

198
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,054
McQueen is fading

199
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,119
fading fast.

200
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:57,721
No..no... no.....no

201
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,460
no.

202
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,679
Welcome back to piston cup talks

203
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,660
around-the-clock where we
do nothing but talk racing

204
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:01,887
let's get to it

205
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:04,193
starting of course
with Lightning McQueen

206
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,392
the season start
just two weeks away

207
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,347
there's still no
official announcement

208
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:11,509
but with number
95 coming off his worst year on record

209
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,429
don't shoot the messenger here folks

210
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,899
I think it's safe to assume that lightning
McQueen's racing days are over

211
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:21,061
meanwhile Jackson's storm is looking
even faster than

212
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:32,299
the number six
and the number 12 cars

213
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,059
are still fighting it out to the lead

214
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,529
but wait, here he comes

215
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,713
it's the fabulous Hudson
Hornet knocking at their door

216
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,810
what's he got up his sleeve
today

217
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:47,209
and there it is with one incredible move
he has passed them

218
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,201
the Hornet takes this decisively

219
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,684
he's left the pen behind

220
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,828
its group chic bohemian

221
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:57,184
it's unbelievable

222
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,239
oh no, this is trouble

223
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:01,211
the Hudson Hornet has
lost control

224
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:04,091
the Hudson Hornet has
lost control

225
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:10,653
what should have been a scene of jubilation
has turned tragic here today folks

226
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,396
we await news on the
Hudson Hornets condition

227
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:17,488
after such a devastating crash
we can only hope that this race today

228
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:19,157
wasn't his last

229
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,273
but if I they got put
together I went back

230
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:29,620
expecting a big welcome,
you know what they said?

231
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:34,941
You are history, moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line

232
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,832
there was a lot left in me.

233
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:41,388
I never got a chance
to show

234
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:57,004
crash! The Hudson Hornet
is out for season

235
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:00,377
hey, stickers

236
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,097
hey, Sal

237
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:04,300
how are you feeling?

238
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:07,621
Yeah great

239
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,163
really really great

240
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,513
you have been thinking about doc again

241
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:14,621
yeah

242
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:18,705
you know they told him
when he was done.

243
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:20,746
He didn't decide.

244
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,390
I don't want what happened to doc

245
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,193
to happen to me

246
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,362
but that hasn't happened

247
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:33,174
no, but I can't go out on the track
and do the same old thing. It won't work

248
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:35,529
then change it up. Try something new.

249
00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:37,170
I don't know Sally

250
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:38,898
don't fear failure

251
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:41,087
be afraid of not having the chance

252
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,613
you have the chance. Doc didn't

253
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,379
and you can either take it or you
can do what you've been doing

254
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:50,079
sitting in here for month

255
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:53,248
and by the way I love what
you've done with the place

256
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:57,159
I mean the monster movie lighting
and the musky air freshener

257
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,023
and don't let anyone tell you
you're not working that primer

258
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:03,232
because wow, I have never found
you more attractive

259
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:06,173
and now that I've been in here
for a couple of minutes the stench

260
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:07,561
I'm getting kind of used to it

261
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,853
okay Sal, I get it. I get it.

262
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:14,272
I miss you lightning. We all do

263
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:21,036
try something new, huh

264
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,418
thank you to work miss Sally

265
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:27,916
did you set him straight with your
lawyerly powers of persuasion

266
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:29,799
is he ready to start training?

267
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:32,039
Well, stinky stickers

268
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:36,053
yes mater, I am.

269
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:40,138
I decide when I'm done.

270
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,279
I was hoping
you'd say that

271
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,492
okay, but I got an idea

272
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:46,268
and I'm gonna need to talk
to rusty and dusty, all right

273
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:49,756
oh, I'll get them on the horn
yeah get them on the horn

274
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:54,157
oops, bono got a speed

275
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,110
my gum, I lost

276
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:01,537
hey, I will you through.

277
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:04,779
I flowed it

278
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:06,636
hey, watch your steps

279
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:14,521
with a circular driveway

280
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,829
you boys need
to get your rusty tails down here

281
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,935
I created a drink in your

282
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,586
yeah, the rutsy
medicated bumper bomb

283
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:25,812
it goes down faster than
elevator for the win bag of them

284
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:28,859
rusty and dusty, hey guys

285
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:31,225
hey newest, good to see you lightning

286
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,431
thanks guys

287
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:34,398
you all here

288
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,027
sorry buddy,
did you just want this call to be private

289
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:38,531
no major. This is perfect

290
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:42,184
listen, thanks everyone for...
for sticking by me

291
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,196
it took me a while to figure it out, but

292
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:47,635
I know now it's time for
me to make some changes

293
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:49,764
changes! What kind of changes

294
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:52,506
it's futile do is ease change man

295
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:54,675
- you're right Fillmore.
- Really

296
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,865
which is why I have an
announcement to make

297
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:00,189
I've thought long and hard about it

298
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,169
done a lot of soul-searching and

299
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,895
considered all of the options

300
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,275
and I finally decided

301
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,209
you do want to keep racing

302
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,878
are you kidding! Of course
I want to keep racing

303
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,932
man for a second..., wait a minute...
i knew that all the time

304
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:21,670
guys, I'm talking about making this my
best season yet

305
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,331
we were hoping you'd say that

306
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:25,620
the thing is if I'm gonna
be faster than storm

307
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:27,040
I need to train like him

308
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,335
we hear you buddy

309
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,147
lightning, we want
you on the road

310
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,479
first thing in the morning

311
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,813
so you can come out and see the
brand new Rusty's racing center

312
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,329
wait, what! Rusteze racing center

313
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,518
yeah, it's got all the fancy bells and

314
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,442
whistles that the kids are
training on these days

315
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,719
we'll send Mack boy
all the directions

316
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,302
now get moving, all right

317
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:49,979
okay

318

well, of course. He
was your mentor

403
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,980
losing him left a giant
hole in the sport

404
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:16,696
yeah

405
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,506
jars of dirt
sacred dirt

406
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:25,480
each of those jars contains dirt from
all the old tracks the doc raced on

407
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,539
Florida International
Thunder Hollow

this Center has quickly become the most
coveted destination for young racers

425
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:23,415
training to make
our team someday

426
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:26,361
and it's where you'll train
until you leave for Florida

427
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:30,849
treadmills, wind tunnels, virtual reality

428
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,325
still working on that

429
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,353

anyone could possibly imagine

430
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:37,519

431
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:40,997
Is that a simulator

432
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:41,948
oh yes.

433
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:44,328
Lightning McQueen I'd
like to introduce you

434
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,328
to the multi-million
dollar flagship

435
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:48,382
of interactive races in Malaysia

436
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:53,155
the XDL 24 GTS RC

437
00:26:53,507 --> 00:26:55,445
the X D L

438
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:01,099
Jaxon storm wishes he had this model

439
00:27:09,974 --> 00:27:12,830

real track to put your hours in

440
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:14,609

00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:18,935
Who is the racer

444
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,637
no, no, no, no. She's not a race

445
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,869
she's a trainer. Cruz Ramirez

446
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:24,542
the best trainer in the business

447
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:27,239
ready to meet it, read it and defeat it

448
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,029
alright, now bring
up those rpms

449
00:27:30,054 --> 00:27:32,425
I like the attitude here

450
00:27:32,557 --> 00:27:34,563
we call her a maestro
of motivation

451
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:36,555
you're driving a little
tense again Ronald

452
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:38,639

open this time

460
00:27:56,807 --> 00:28:00,896
gotta see that truck. Oh, No.
Homesick again people

461
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,659
you guys gotta work through this stuff

462
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,021
so when your big chance
comes along you could take

463
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:13,814
hey, cruise. Oh, hey mr. Sterling

464
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:15,649
I'd like to introduce you

465
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,499
to Lightning McQueen

466
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:18,048
I hear you're the
maestro

467
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:21,190
mr. Sterling, did you say
Lightning McQueen was here?

468
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,569
Because I don't see him anywhere

469
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,317
uh, but he's right here

470
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:26,865
do you not see him

471
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,458
nope still don't see him

472
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:29,996
it's right in front of you

473
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:31,807
it is Lightning McQueen

474
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:33,649
he is obviously an
imposter

475
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,427
he looks old and broken-down.

476
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:35,864
Hey

477
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:37,126
with flabby tires

478
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:37,961
I do not

479
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,177
use that! Woah

480
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:44,712
oh yeah, I see I can use that
energy from motivation right

481
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:47,608
it's all about motivation mr.
McQueen

482
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:51,447
you can use anything negative as
fuel to push through to the positive

483
00:28:51,472 --> 00:28:54,519
ah, pretty
positive ever since I was a rookie.

484
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,078
I am so excited that I get to train you

485
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,133
I grew up watching you on TV

486
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:01,002
ha, is that right

487
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:02,908
these young guys
are great and all

488
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,099
but I like a challenge

489
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,111
ha ha, not that much over.

490
00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:09,760
In fact, I call you
my senior project

491
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:15,021
we need to loosen
those ancient joints

492
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:17,729
first, the wheels and bone

493
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,646
and rest and bone and rest.
Join me. Rest

494
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:23,073
and rest

495
00:29:23,135 --> 00:29:24,557
is all these resting necessary

496
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:27,815
I am working with you and
slowly and peach for you much

497
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:30,051
peach for your much

498
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:31,104
now, wheel

499
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:33,057
to the fry

500
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:36,695
what is there, its your lines

501
00:29:37,114 --> 00:29:37,911
now backwards

502
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:39,951
what is there

503
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:41,264
when we will go to the simulator

504
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:44,368
good morning mr. Macqueen .looking good

505
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:47,448
why

506
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,173
this will get oiler to places
it hasn't been in a long time

507
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:54,161
is that a drip pan

508
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,069
just in case

509
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,659
how old you think I am?

510
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,077
Visualize yourself driving
fast on a steep hill

511
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,044
I'll be back in the field

512
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:03,725
visualize...! wait! Wait!
Cruze

513
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:05,083
I feel what

514
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,035
I just like go on the simulator

515
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,341
how's it hanging

516
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,773
drip pan!

517
00:30:17,587 --> 00:30:18,392

518
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,171
Okay, day three. Treadmill

519
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,904
offset maximum
speed to conserve your energy

520
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:28,059
what I want you to do, is
visualize beating this guy

521
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:32,295
storm! Uh-huh that's right
get him .get him mr. McQueen.

522
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,117
Get him

523
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:35,370
this is only going like five
miles an hour

524
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:38,198
we'll work up to the higher speed
right after you take your nap

525
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:39,168
nap!

526
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:40,909
Do I need a nap!

527
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,681
I am not taking a nap

528
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,157
how is your nap mr. McQueen?

529
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,939
It was kind of
refreshing actually

530
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:56,208
oh,.....okay what do you .....hey

531
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:58,486
you have been driving
on tires a long time

532
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:00,899
and you never stopped to get to know them

533
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,540
I'm sorry, what?

534
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:03,170
Tires are individuals

535
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,701
you should give each a name

536
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:05,677
name!

537
00:31:06,654 --> 00:31:07,991
I will not be doing that

538
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:10,801
minor names. Maria, marika, ronaldo
and Debby Richardson

539
00:31:11,195 --> 00:31:11,548
what?

540
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:12,389
Long story

541
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,005
may I have my tires back so I
can go on the simulator please

542
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:16,318
name them!

543
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:19,053
Lefty, righty, backy
, backy junior. Okay

544
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:19,985
does this make you mad?

545
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,816
Yes it does

546
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:21,718
use that!

547
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,678
Emerge and kneel

548
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:25,369
emerge and kneel

549
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:29,670
now, you got some tire damage

550
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:33,081

551
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,144

552
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,852
Thank You Cruz. I'm done

553
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:40,995
mr McQueen,
where are you going

554
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,480
to the futue!

555
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:49,509
Okay, here we go. Here we go. How
do I do this? Come on baby

556
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,146
mr McQueen

557
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:53,197
cruise, thank you for the old
man training as crazy as it was

558
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:56,524
but I'm warmed up enough and now I need you
to launch this thing

559
00:31:56,555 --> 00:31:58,875
mr. McQueen wait until you can handle
it please

560
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,971
there are no shortcuts

561
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:01,622
okay, we'll just see about that

562
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:04,928
all right, my star racer
is on the simulator

563
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,591
why! Yes I am.

564
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,626
Well, let's see you
take it out for a spin

565
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:13,264
right away mr. Sterling
owner of the company

566
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:17,337
okay, have fun

567
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,416
this is what I'm
talking about

568
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,814
whoa! Didn't know about those

569
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,307
wait, what you didn't
say is it talking

570
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:26,408
the flag is out

571
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:28,137
but I don't see the
flag.... what do I do

572
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:29,606
go! Go! Go!

573
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:34,112
Oh..., that is sensetive

574
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,443
you have hit the wall

575
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:37,751
it shouldn`t be this hard, should it?

576
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:39,088
You have hit the wall

577
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:42,244
you are fighting the simulator
just race like you always do

578
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:44,399
you have hit the wall

579
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,591
there can't be this many walls
in a ring on the track

580
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:48,694
you have been passed by jackson storm

581
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:49,878
wait, storm is in here

582
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:51,311
the motivation

583
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,319
storm races at 2:07

584
00:32:53,358 --> 00:32:56,050
pick it up mr. McQueen!
I am trying

585
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,793
you have hit the wall

586
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:04,826
mr. McQueen from now and from there
we will work you up to this

587
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:07,120
I am fine Cruz. I can do it, okay

588
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,807
you have jumped a barrier

589
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:16,305
you have hit two vechiles

590
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:18,733

591
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,902
You have to see an ambulance

592
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,548
you are on fire

593
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:29,041
danger! Danger! You
are going wrong way

594
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:33,053
look out! Turn it off! Turn it off!
Get these things off from me

595
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:39,725
you have crashed! You have crashed!

596
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,749
Are you alright?
You have crashed

597
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:43,778
I have crashed

598
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,009
your all washed up McQueen

599
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,989
I'm sorry, what!

600
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:10,539
I said floors all
washed up and clean

601
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:12,619
oh, right.

602
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,559
Thank you very much

603
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:16,175
good luck

604
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,989
hey, lightning. Come on in. I got
something to show you

605
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,286
you ready

606
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:24,281
for what?

607
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,506
You are about to become the
biggest brand in racing

608
00:34:33,092 --> 00:34:36,788
we are talking about saturation on
all continents for every demographic

609
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:40,312
movie deals, incommercials
, product endorsements

610
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,674
mud flaps

611
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,355
of course, you will
be rich beyond belief

612
00:34:44,503 --> 00:34:45,939
do you think
you're famous now?

613
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:49,639
How you'd be mad about the simulator

614
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,056
I mean this is all great mr.
Sterling I guess but.

615
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:55,398
I don't know .I never really
thought of myself as a brand

616
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:59,221
oh, no. Do I? I'm a fan maybe
your most avid

617
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,815
I think of this as your
legacy

618
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:07,658
it sounds like something that
happens after you're done racing

619
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:12,400
mr. Sterling. What is this about?

620
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:16,286
Look lightning!
I'm not gonna race you what

621
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,471
what!...what do you mean not racing

622
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:19,518
hold on! Hold on!

623
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,666
I'm not going to Florida.

624
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:21,466
Lightning!

625
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:26,109
You have no idea how
excited I was to get you here

626
00:35:26,148 --> 00:35:28,734
because I knew I knew you'd be
back

627
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:32,187
this gonna be the comeback
story of the year but

628
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:36,421
your speed and performance
just aren't where they need to be

629
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:37,816
I'm sorry

630
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:42,913
we're talking about speed on a simulator.
Listen how crazy that sounds

631
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:44,566
look, I'm trying to help you

632
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:47,790
as your sponsor yes but also
as your friend

633
00:35:48,394 --> 00:35:50,665
your racing days are coming
to an end

634
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:53,648
every time you lose, you damage
yourself

635
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,086
damage the brand you mean.

636
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:57,966
Oh, lightening. Come on

637
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,981
you've done the work now
move on to the next phase

638
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:02,780
and reap the reward

639
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:06,143
the racing is the
reward not the stuff.

640
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:10,849
I don't want to cash in. I want to feel
the rush of moving 200 miles an hour

641
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,111
inches from the other guys

642
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:14,419
pushing myself faster
than I thought I could go

643
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:16,931
that's the reward mr. Sterling.

644
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,158
Oh, lightening. Come on.

645
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,273
Look, I can do this. I can I promise.

646
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:25,683
I'll train like I did with Doc

647
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:29,188
I'll get my tires dirty on every
turn track from here in the Florida

648
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:33,002
I can start right there on fireball
Beach where all the old greats used to race

649
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:35,173
get your tires dirty

650
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,248
that's how you're gonna
get faster than storm

651
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,899
yes exactly

652
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,103
I mean sacred dirt, right

653
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:46,169
mr. Sterlin if you care about
my legacy, the one that doc started

654
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:49,740
you'll let me do this. I
promise you I will win.

655
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:51,104
I don't know

656
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:53,399
what you're asking it's to risky

657
00:36:53,438 --> 00:36:56,229
come on, you like it .I can tell

658
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,905
it's got that little comeback story
of the year feel to it, doesn't it?

659
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,698
One race

660
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,788
if you don't win at
Florida, you'll retire

661
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,125
look... if I don't win also
I will hold the mud flaps you got

662
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,720
but if I do win, I decide
when I'm done

663
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:19,088
deal

664
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,741
deal.

665
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:25,109
Thank You mr. Sterling.
You won't be sorry

666
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,138
just one thing and this is only because
I don't like taking chances

667
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,765
you're taking someone with you

668
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:39,429
you talked him into it

669
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,056
way to go mr. Macqueen

670
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:46,143
Cruz! You could talk to snowmobile
into an air conditioner

671
00:37:46,174 --> 00:37:47,255
you're going with me

672
00:37:47,294 --> 00:37:48,446
with that thing

673
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,489
yeah, you still need my help

674
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,836
you're brittle like a fossil.

675
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,488
I don't need a trainer out here Cruz

676
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:02,830
you're old

677
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,019
what if you have fallen 0n
this Beach and can't get up

678
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:08,536
well, life's a beach and
then you drive

679
00:38:11,144 --> 00:38:12,861
macqueen, thank you

680
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:14,388
this is beautiful

681
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:17,573
I can see why mr. Sterling said you
wanted to train out here

682
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:19,726
as soon as this thing's
booted up, we'll get

683
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:21,566
you on the treadmill and
I'll track your speed

684
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:25,767
what! No! The whole idea
is getting my tires dirty.

685
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:29,493
Real Racing not driving on that
thing when I've got the sand

686
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:30,730
and the whole earth

687
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:35,600
oh, okay.
Leweege let's do this

688
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:38,740
welcome a racer
to fireball beach

689
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:42,359
historical for
today's great test of speed

690
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:46,335
our finish line will be the
abandoned appear in the distance

691

693
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:56,541

that? Yeah I did

694

hey, what was my speed
I don't know

697
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,739
I can only track you on the treadmill

698
00:39:20,764 --> 00:39:22,059
no treadmills.

699
00:39:22,512 --> 00:39:24,909
Oh, what about Hamilton

703
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:34,224
Race cars don't have phones
cruze

704
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,032

706
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:41,679

your speeds to Hamilton

707
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,899

on sands you gotta ease into your
start or your tires can grab okay okay

715
00:40:08,638 --> 00:40:10,779

line on the compacted sand

730
00:40:42,354 --> 00:40:44,717

gonna spin out

731
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:45,739
let's do this thing

732
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,617
on your mark

733
00:40:46,682 --> 00:40:47,643
you try to go

734
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,279
134 miles

735
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,867
out of range. Out of range

I didn't wanna hit a crab

738
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:00,570
you gotta be kidding me
what! It was cute

739
00:41:07,275 --> 00:41:10,092
now, your are gonna pick on
slow to let your tires grab

740
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:14,061
yes! And pick a straight line
on hard Sansy. Don't spin out

741
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:17,233
and all the Crabbies have gone night-night

742
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:18,223
mr. McQueen

743
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:20,190
all right, let's go again

744
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,399
150 miles per hour

745
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,893
175 miles per hour

746
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:31,226

749
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,349
You topped out at 198
198 that's it

750
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:44,056
still slower than storm.

751
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:48,700
I wasted my whole day
I wouldn't say that

752
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:51,944
it did feel great to
be out here doing real racing

753

805
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:21,283
I am about to commit a moving demolition

806
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,790

turn right to go left

812
00:45:46,094 --> 00:45:48,521

turn right to go left

813
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,705

Get out of my way

817
00:46:20,388 --> 00:46:21,896
hey, I am driving here

818
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,030

819
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:37,033
I am flying
no, I am not flying.

820
00:46:40,093 --> 00:46:41,532
I got it

821
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:45,157

829
00:47:25,864 --> 00:47:27,864

830
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,705
Oh, god run!

831
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:39,405

832
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,458
Cruz

833
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:54,871
miss fritter is down

834
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:06,044

837
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,606

838
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,210
Miss Ritter's can get up right folks
she is not pleased

839
00:48:23,356 --> 00:48:29,610
you about to feel the wrath of the lower
Bell Bell County unified school desperate

840
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:44,180
ladies and gentlemen we have a winner

841
00:48:44,259 --> 00:48:46,224
francis beltline

842
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:49,520

843
00:48:49,545 --> 00:48:52,150
cruz cruz No no no no

844
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:12,780
whipple filter

845
00:49:18,175 --> 00:49:19,966
it`s lightning mcqueen

846
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:24,160
got my tires dirty at
thunder hollow

847
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:28,859
the fans here in Thunder Hollow
still buzzing over

848
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,678
tonight's unexpected
appearance of Lightning McQueen

849
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:33,413
he has always been my favorite

850
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:37,025
my garage is covered from head
to toe with 95 posters

851
00:49:37,948 --> 00:49:38,948
so.

852
00:49:39,674 --> 00:49:42,102
Trophies are kind of nice
don't you think.

853
00:49:43,173 --> 00:49:47,293
I mean I know you got like a
billion of them so you would know.

854
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:50,644
I still
can't believe I won

855
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,875
it's pretty shiny, I have
never seen one up close

856
00:49:53,953 --> 00:49:57,141
looks like they spent a lot of money on it
I mean I think it's real nut up

857
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:59,163
stop! Just stop! Okay, Cruz

858
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:01,963
you don't even know
you don't even have one clue.

859
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:03,310
I was just trying to....

860
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:06,099
do you know
what happens if I lose this race

861
00:50:06,997 --> 00:50:10,208
every mile of this trip was to get
me faster than Jackson storm

862
00:50:10,452 --> 00:50:11,221
faster.

863
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:14,572
I start off getting
nowhere for a week on a simulator

864
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:16,742
I lose a whole day with
you on fireball beach

865
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:20,339
and then I waste
tonight and a crosshairs for miss fritter

866
00:50:20,815 --> 00:50:23,096
I'm stuck in the same speed I
was a month ago

867
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:27,582
I can't get any faster because I'm too
busy taking care of my trainer

868
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:30,875
this is my last chance Cruz

869
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:36,215
last final finito. If I
lose, I never get to do this again

870
00:50:36,482 --> 00:50:40,259
if you were a racer you'd
know what I'm talking about but you're not

871
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,918
so you don't.

872
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:49,326
Mack! Pull over!

873
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:51,775
Now!
Now!

874
00:50:53,423 --> 00:50:55,821
Okay okay pulling over
pulling overr

875
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:03,939
ask me if I dreamed of being a trainer
mr. Macqueen go ahead

876
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:10,255
ask me if I got up in the dark to
run laps before school every day

877
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:15,016
ask me if I saved every penny to buy a
ticket to the races when they came to town

878
00:51:15,368 --> 00:51:19,807
ask me if I did that so
that I could be a trainer someday ask me

879
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:21,907
no.

880
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,389
I wanted to become a racer forever

881
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:27,901
because of you.

882
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:35,103
I used to watch you onTV

883
00:51:35,251 --> 00:51:37,200
flying in the air

884
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:39,676
you seemed so

885
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,146
fearless

886
00:51:45,158 --> 00:51:46,377
dream small cruz

887
00:51:47,049 --> 00:51:48,893
that's what my
family used to say

888
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:51,708
dream small or not at all

889
00:51:54,294 --> 00:51:55,719
they were just trying to protect me

890
00:51:57,268 --> 00:52:02,601
but I was the fastest kid in town and I
was gonna prove them wrong

891
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,313
what happened

892
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,611
when I got to my first race.

893
00:52:09,313 --> 00:52:10,673
I figured it out what

894
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:12,696
what

895
00:52:15,295 --> 00:52:16,506
that I didn't belong

896
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:20,340
the other racers
look nothing like me

897
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:27,232
they were bigger
and stronger and so confident

898
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:31,151
and when they started their engines

899
00:52:32,936 --> 00:52:33,765
that was it.

900
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:36,089
I knew I'd never be a racer.

901
00:52:39,637 --> 00:52:40,403
I just left

902
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:43,881
it was my one shot

903
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:46,064
and I didn't take it

904
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:53,272
yeah so uh

905
00:52:53,491 --> 00:52:56,388
I'm gonna head back to
the training center

906
00:52:56,413 --> 00:52:59,039
I think we both know
it's for the best

907
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:04,024
but can I ask you something

908
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:08,078
what was it like for you

909
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:10,709
when you showed up to your first race

910
00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:13,334
how did you know you could do it.

911
00:53:15,595 --> 00:53:19,202
I don't know, I just never
thought I couldn't

912
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,316
it was shiny with that felt like

913
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,505
good luck mr. McQueen

914
00:53:30,056 --> 00:53:30,989
cruz

915
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:33,723
cruz, wait

916
00:53:38,672 --> 00:53:41,952

917
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:57,275
Champion for the ages
, Chick Hicks here

918
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,524
coming to you live from
Chick Hicks studios

919
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:03,322
where I'm joined once again by
next-gen racing expert, Natalie certain

920
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:06,630
thanks chick, Piston Cup
champion Jackson storm

921
00:54:06,655 --> 00:54:10,487
set a new record today when he pulled
off the fastest lap ever recorded

922
00:54:10,512 --> 00:54:14,957
an unprecedented 213
miles an hour

923
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,061
so what do you think certain

924
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:19,609
stormy boy gonna start the
season with another win

925
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:20,899
highly likely chick

926
00:54:20,938 --> 00:54:24,672
based on his recent run times and
forecasted track temperatures on race day

927
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:28,793
storms chances of winning are
95.2 %

928
00:54:28,824 --> 00:54:29,853
that low huh

929
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,157
oh and in case you missed it

930
00:54:32,182 --> 00:54:34,502
talk of the track tonight is
lightning mcqueen finding

931
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:36,949
yet another way to
embarrass himself

932
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:38,888
at a demolition
derby whoa

933
00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:39,607
wow

934
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:42,265
almost makes me feel sorry
for the guy not really

935
00:54:42,843 --> 00:54:44,751
here's what his new sponsor had to say

936
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:47,096
everyone relax, the 95 is gonna race

937
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:48,895
lightnings just
taking a somewhat

938
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,190
unconventional approach
to this race

939
00:54:51,253 --> 00:54:53,426
it's one of the things his fans love

940
00:54:53,473 --> 00:54:55,772
huh yeah right
talk about humiliating

941
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:59,089
show I won't even bother to
show up in Florida

942
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,563
that could be for the best chick

943
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:06,349
even if he does race. McQueen's
probability of winning is 1.2 percent.

944
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,041
Wow

945
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:10,239
numbers never lie I'm
willing to predict tonight

946
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:14,696
that lightning McQueen's
racing career will be over within the week

947
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:17,280
it might even be over now

948
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:19,819
I mean I knew his career
was stuck in the.....

949
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,036
berty find a came from the rusty bump bump

950
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,081
wait for me in the dark
make it in mark bump bump

951
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,929
and that's the way
done it's not a fun bump bump

952
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,933
lifting my funk making
sculptures out of junk

953
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,075
what's it

954
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:40,734
there we go, somebody's
interrupting genius

955
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,378
well, hey there buddy

956
00:55:43,701 --> 00:55:44,437
mater!

957
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:48,245
You know I was just thinking of
you and here you are looking right at me

958
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:49,488
you see me okay

959
00:55:49,968 --> 00:55:54,265
wait a second, let me see here.
Is that better

960
00:55:54,873 --> 00:55:57,085
looking you straight in the eye there pal

961
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,096
hey sorry about calling so late

962
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,159
not for me it's not

963
00:56:01,184 --> 00:56:03,620
I'm always burning

974
00:56:33,376 --> 00:56:37,129

thinking about that you know what

975
00:56:37,222 --> 00:56:39,559
what we should do when I'm
not on the road anymore

976
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:41,860
what do you mean not on the road

977
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:43,925
you know

978
00:56:45,462 --> 00:56:47,158
mater I can't do this
forever

979
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:53,485
I'm just not getting
anywhere with the trainee

980
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,719
if anything I've gotten
slower not faster

981
00:56:55,828 --> 00:56:57,900

982
00:56:57,986 --> 00:56:59,309

985
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:07,891
I feel like I'm all out of ideas

986
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,259
all right, let me think

987
00:57:10,689 --> 00:57:13,559
oh, you know what I do

988
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,435
I don't know I got nothing

989
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,917
I guess I ain't dark when it comes to that.

990
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:24,180
I would give anything to talk
to him right now

991
00:57:24,336 --> 00:57:26,738
if there was nobody smarter
no knock

992
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:29,617
well except for maybe
whoever taught him

993
00:57:30,226 --> 00:57:31,055
wait, what?

994
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:33,649
I mean everybody was
taught by somebody right

995
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:34,912
take my cousin Dora

996
00:57:34,937 --> 00:57:37,766
he taught me
how to sing and whistled at the same time

997
00:57:37,806 --> 00:57:39,453
he was very musical that way

998
00:57:39,478 --> 00:57:40,234
smoky

999
00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:43,967
mater you're brilliant

1000

your teeth

00:57:46,043 --> 00:57:47,377

1030
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:05,954

1031
01:00:05,979 --> 01:00:07,900

1032
01:00:15,604 --> 01:00:17,770

1034
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:33,099

1036
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:43,631
Wow, this track could talk

1037
01:00:46,671 --> 01:00:50,273

1040
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:21,325
way easy without the school bus of death
trying to kill us

1041
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,974
yeah, no kidding.

1042
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:42,014
I am starting to think
I might never meet you

1043
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:43,679
smokey!

1044
01:01:47,777 --> 01:01:51,533
He is alive
I know why you're

1045
01:01:53,026 --> 01:01:54,383

1046
01:01:58,376 --> 01:01:59,593
I'll tell you what

1047
01:01:59,618 --> 01:02:02,651
these folks are gonna get a kick out of
me the HUDs boy

1048
01:02:02,676 --> 01:02:07,105

1049
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,352

1050
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:14,074
act civilized, we got company

1051
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:16,163

1052
01:02:16,988 --> 01:02:18,964

1053
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,457
Would you look at that
what?

1054
01:02:23,482 --> 01:02:25,805
Look at the biggest racing legends ever

1055
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:31,539
jr. Midnight Moon, River Scott who is
she, stormer Nash and she had 38 wins

1056
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:35,170
well as I live and breathe if it
ain't Lightning McQueen

1057
01:02:35,217 --> 01:02:37,385
miss Nash
it's a pleasure to meet you

1058
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,759
you had a tough year haven't you?

1059
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,139
Oh uh should you be running practice laps
in Florida by now

1060
01:02:43,246 --> 01:02:45,646
yeah sure
you're here to steal our secret

1061
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,498
looking for you lost mojo.

1062
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:50,929
Wow, you don't mince words
around here do you

1063
01:02:51,497 --> 01:02:53,602
truth is always quicker, kid

1064
01:03:15,206 --> 01:03:17,544
look, she is an angel

1065
01:03:17,986 --> 01:03:19,530

1066
01:03:19,555 --> 01:03:23,178
But she used to have serious eyes for her

1067
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,729
oh really
even if I did it wouldn't have mattered

1068
01:03:26,754 --> 01:03:29,663
huh didn't like fast women and that left
me out

1069
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:33,479
the new one just fast
she was fearless

1070
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,843
the second I saw my first race I just
knew I had to get in there

1071
01:03:36,882 --> 01:03:39,449
of course the fellows in charge
didn't like the idea

1072
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,312
of a lady racer showing them up

1073
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:43,362
so they wouldn't let me
have a number

1074
01:03:43,503 --> 01:03:46,952
what did you do
I stole one, what

1075
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:49,383
I still short to take no for an answer

1076
01:03:49,595 --> 01:03:53,506
right River, if we waited for an invitation
we might have never raced

1077
01:03:53,531 --> 01:03:56,160
and once we got on the track
we didn't want to leave and

1078
01:03:56,185 --> 01:03:57,762
that's how doc felt too

1079
01:03:57,808 --> 01:04:00,159
you should have seen him when he first came
to town

1080
01:04:00,198 --> 01:04:03,679
shiny blue paint
not just a Hudson Hornet

1081
01:04:03,704 --> 01:04:07,854
he was already calling himself
the fabulous Hudson Hornet

1082
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:12,068
did we ever ride him on that
not for long

1083
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:16,957
hud was the fastest race of this side
of the Mississippi, until he wasn't

1084
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:18,413
what

1085
01:04:19,433 --> 01:04:22,078
everything changed when
the rookie showed up

1086
01:04:28,422 --> 01:04:33,367
he took all at no time to work his way
through the best racers in both Carolini

1087
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:39,014
fast river, fast loo
even junior

1088
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:42,411
but there was still the rookie to deal with

1089
01:04:45,118 --> 01:04:47,494
he tried slamming
him into the wall

1090
01:04:49,436 --> 01:04:53,530
but hud never touched anything
unless he wanted to

1091
01:05:03,534 --> 01:05:07,158
that rookie never saw anything
like that before

1092
01:05:07,197 --> 01:05:09,455
docked it oh
are you kidding

1093
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,896
couldn`t wipe the smile off his face
for a week after that.

1094
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:16,920
I wish I could have seen him like that

1095
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:18,710
like what

1096
01:05:19,884 --> 01:05:20,884
so happy

1097
01:05:27,918 --> 01:05:30,829
you didn't come all
this way for a quarter of oil, did you?

1098
01:05:32,218 --> 01:05:34,248
I need your help smokey

1099
01:05:34,688 --> 01:05:37,413
yeah, what kind of help

1100
01:05:38,487 --> 01:05:41,100
that's just it, I I'm not sure

1101
01:05:41,803 --> 01:05:46,408
all I know is if I lose in Florida
it`s over for me

1102
01:05:46,923 --> 01:05:49,375
what happened to doc will happen to me

1103
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,020
what did happen to him

1104
01:05:53,503 --> 01:05:59,719
no, racing was the best part of his life
and when it ended he

1105
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:03,863
we both know he was never the same
after that

1106
01:06:04,934 --> 01:06:06,591
is that what you think

1107
01:06:08,754 --> 01:06:11,520
come on
I want to show you something

1108
01:06:17,146 --> 01:06:19,185
you got the first part right

1109
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:24,445
the crash broke HUD's body and the
no more racing broke his heart

1110
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:28,299
he cut himself off disappeared
to Radiator Springs

1111
01:06:28,788 --> 01:06:31,749
son-of-a-gone
didn't talk to me for 50 years

1112
01:06:32,494 --> 01:06:36,679
but in one day
the letters started coming

1113
01:06:48,435 --> 01:06:51,669
and every last one of them
was about you

1114
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:59,754
yeah, I'd love racing
but coaching you.

1115
01:07:00,762 --> 01:07:03,659
I had never seen the old grump so happy.

1116
01:07:04,288 --> 01:07:06,639
I owe it all to the doc

1117
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:10,418
racing wasn't the best part of HUD's life

1118
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:12,839
you were

1119
01:07:16,506 --> 01:07:20,232
ready to go out for little carbon air boy
yes I am

1120
01:07:23,726 --> 01:07:26,162
give it too much travel
you in the tulips

1121
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:30,400
hey, lightning you might
want to take notes on it

1122
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:45,191
you got a lot of stuff, kid

1123
01:08:00,461 --> 01:08:04,973
hud saw something in you
that you don't even see in yourself

1124
01:08:06,376 --> 01:08:10,628
are you ready to go find it
yes sir

1125
01:08:19,098 --> 01:08:20,768
all right, all right

1126
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:28,545
lesson one: You're old accept it
I told him that

1127
01:08:28,662 --> 01:08:32,858
he is probably losing his hearing
he said you're old, I heard him

1128
01:08:32,897 --> 01:08:37,509
you'll never be as fast as storm but
you can be smarter than him

1129
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:41,910
okay what do I
you said you were in a demolition derby

1130
01:08:41,942 --> 01:08:44,288
yeah it was terrible
are you sure?

1131
01:08:44,502 --> 01:08:46,533
Because there's not a scratch on you

1132
01:08:48,942 --> 01:08:52,485
funny what a racer can do when he's
not overthinking things

1133
01:08:54,442 --> 01:08:56,619
Shannon spokes here at
Florida International

1134
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,486
jackson storm clocked
214 miles per hour today

1135
01:09:06,305 --> 01:09:09,292
you want to beat the storm
you need someone to stand in for

1136
01:09:09,317 --> 01:09:10,845
like a sparring partner

1137
01:09:11,179 --> 01:09:13,796
I'm not so sure
I not a racer

1138
01:09:13,906 --> 01:09:16,261
just a trainer
go ahead and cut it

1139
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:25,003
yeah, with no muffler
you even sound like storm

1140
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,601
oh you're going down McQueen

1141
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:30,320
get that arthritis rail
keister onto the tracks, so I can

1142
01:09:30,345 --> 01:09:33,229
put you into the old folks
home against your will

1143
01:09:34,686 --> 01:09:35,708
how is that

1144
01:09:36,424 --> 01:09:41,023
it gonna work, work for me
, I'm good .yeah what ever she says it

1145
01:09:41,304 --> 01:09:44,086
you didn't show up in Florida
for qualifying

1146
01:09:44,111 --> 01:09:46,115
so you'll be starting dead last

1147
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:48,539
I'll give you three
left to catch

1148
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:51,270
go through the entire field
in three laps

1149
01:09:51,295 --> 01:09:54,449
you wanna beat storm or
not? Yes of course I do

1150
01:09:54,474 --> 01:09:56,286
well, then go

1151
01:09:58,354 --> 01:09:59,486
come on, kid

1152
01:10:10,309 --> 01:10:13,432
all right, looks like
we got some work to do

1153
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:18,029
reflexes are the first to go

1154
01:10:23,156 --> 01:10:24,637
why are we in a field

1155
01:10:25,283 --> 01:10:28,903
sneak through that window
what is that mean? I don't know!

1156
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:29,583
Go.

1157
01:10:39,508 --> 01:10:41,141
Not cool man, not cool

1158
01:10:45,988 --> 01:10:47,410
let`s roll it back

1159
01:10:49,655 --> 01:10:51,854
do you even want to be out here

1160
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,072
only two days left, kid
we gotta work harder

1161
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,729
wait aminute, who is that?

1162
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:05,730
I put McQueen in there
to give you some real competition.

1163
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:12,949
HUD was a master of letting
the other cars do the work for him

1164
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:16,859
he used to say, playing to him is like you were
two June bugs on a summer night

1165
01:11:16,884 --> 01:11:18,669
he stole that form me

1166
01:11:18,845 --> 01:11:21,461
drafting, I've never had to do that

1167
01:11:21,532 --> 01:11:24,251
yeah that's when you were fast

1168
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,839
now you're slow and old and
rickety and....

1169
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,399
okay, okay, I get it

1170
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:33,944
the new you has to look for
opportunities you never knew were there

1171
01:11:36,724 --> 01:11:38,252
sneak through the window

1172
01:11:40,312 --> 01:11:42,806
sneak through the window
what?

1173
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,202
When a window opens
take it

1174
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,556
yes!

1175
01:11:56,728 --> 01:11:58,173
I made it

1176
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:01,914
let`s go, let`s move

1177
01:12:03,204 --> 01:12:04,331
reflexes!

1178
01:12:06,098 --> 01:12:08,625
Alright quito turn up the heat
okay

1179
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:18,525
alright, look who finally showed up

1180
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:25,214
this where we cut our racing team
in the woods

1181
01:12:25,401 --> 01:12:29,668
let's just say the boom
was always shinemoons

1182
01:12:30,371 --> 01:12:34,285
if the moon didn`t shine we
didn't have to... oh, nevermind

1183
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:37,228
we ran moonshine dummy
oh!

1184
01:12:37,325 --> 01:12:40,959
By the way, no lights
instinct only

1185
01:13:28,846 --> 01:13:31,910
macqueen still not here, didn't he pull
this when he was a rookie

1186
01:13:32,327 --> 01:13:33,838
this is my grandfather
told me

1187
01:13:34,236 --> 01:13:38,888
all right, we got time for one last race.
Hurry this along awesome

1188
01:13:38,974 --> 01:13:41,189
we got to get you to Florida
go

1189
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:49,209
maybe it's best that he doesn't show up
you know after how last season how did

1190
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:58,541
let me put it this way I'm not losing any sleep
wondering where Lightning McQueen is!

1191
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,330
Come on! Come on!

1192
01:14:15,044 --> 01:14:16,660
Here you go!

1193
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:33,027
Macqueen is fading! Macqueen is fading!
Fading! Fast fast!

1194
01:14:42,193 --> 01:14:45,486
Did you see that?
That was incredible

1195
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,662
sorry. I didn't mean to...

1196
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:03,598
hey, awesome it's time to hit the road

1197
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:13,005
yeah, I wanna to thank everyone for
the training

1198
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:16,409
we better get going to Florida

1199
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,973
welcome to Racing's greatest day

1200
01:15:28,998 --> 01:15:31,881
we're beachside at the
Florida International Speedway

1201
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,488
to kick off a new season
of Piston Cup racing

1202
01:15:34,513 --> 01:15:36,287
it's the Florida 500

1203
01:15:36,312 --> 01:15:40,683
43 cars in a quarter million fans
await today's intense contest of strategy

1204
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:44,943
skill but most of all speed. This crowd is here for
one great day of racing

1205
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:49,078
I'm bob cutlass joined as always by my
broadcasting partner darrell cartrip

1206
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:51,569
and stat sensation natalie certain

1207
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:54,237
I've never seen the numbers lineup for storm
like they do today Bob

1208
01:15:54,262 --> 01:15:58,159
storm should be ninety six point
eight percent unstoppable

1209
01:15:58,349 --> 01:15:59,881
well, don't overlook Lightning McQueen

1210
01:16:00,005 --> 01:16:02,067
whipple filter

1211
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:06,388
we've heard stories of the unusual way
McQueen trained to get here

1212
01:16:06,635 --> 01:16:09,222
now the question is
did it work?

1213
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:23,717
Speed. I am..... speed.

1214
01:16:28,346 --> 01:16:32,232
Hey boss, they call the racers to the track

1215
01:16:35,176 --> 01:16:37,495
Jeff board? How does
today's talent stack up?

1216
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,016
Oh I think we're in for a treat
today these racers

1217
01:16:40,055 --> 01:16:44,884
hey McQueen, win one first old
guys ...we will do Jeff

1218
01:16:46,294 --> 01:16:52,409
hey guys, stickers
hey Sal, are you okay? Yeah

1219
01:16:52,544 --> 01:16:53,581
absolutely

1220
01:16:54,835 --> 01:16:58,749
listen, you're gonna do great today and
and no matter what happens

1221
01:16:59,098 --> 01:17:01,738
I'm gonna move on to the next
rookie and forget I ever knew you

1222
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:05,358
I'm glad you're here.

1223
01:17:06,061 --> 01:17:09,775
Wow, nice costume come
here let's get a picture

1224
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,406
it's so great to meet my number
one fan

1225
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:13,792
what ajerk!

1226
01:17:13,946 --> 01:17:17,047
She's not a fan storm
oh, hey there champ.

1227
01:17:17,078 --> 01:17:20,177
I heard you're selling mud flap after today
is that true?

1228
01:17:20,294 --> 01:17:23,149
Hey you put me down
for the first case okay

1229
01:17:35,605 --> 01:17:38,179
lightning macqueen!

1230
01:17:38,948 --> 01:17:42,342
Hey lightning!
Hey mr. Sterling!

1231
01:17:42,497 --> 01:17:47,057
To the future. Hey champ
yeah, to the future.

1232
01:17:47,548 --> 01:17:51,149
Hey...... just focus on what
you're here to do kid

1233
01:17:51,697 --> 01:17:56,559
thanks smokey.
Now, go make HUD proud. You got it

1234
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,736
lightning McQueen is making steady progress
in the early parts of this race

1235
01:18:11,761 --> 01:18:15,297
it won't be enough to catch storm
considered he started head last

1236
01:18:15,322 --> 01:18:17,289
I don't think he's doing
half bad out there

1237
01:18:25,963 --> 01:18:30,029
not too shabby
keep this up you'll finish in the top ten

1238
01:18:30,091 --> 01:18:32,025
top ten is not going to cut it smokey

1239
01:18:32,056 --> 01:18:33,673
I got to go all the way

1240
01:18:33,929 --> 01:18:36,209
so dig in
remember your training

1241
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,016
find storm and chase him down.

1242
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:40,277
Oh tell him he has three
laps to catch me

1243
01:18:40,302 --> 01:18:42,572
Cruz says you've got
three laps to catch her

1244
01:18:42,597 --> 01:18:44,785
okay. Tell her thanks

1245
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:52,527
Cruz, what are you doing here?

1246
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,595
Oh mr. Sterling I was

1247
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,061
I would like you to head back
to the training center right away,

1248
01:18:56,210 --> 01:19:00,443
oh! But why? I need you to get Kurt up to
speed for the race next weekend

1249
01:19:00,907 --> 01:19:04,566
wait, not Kurt he's the bug guy, right
the other one Ronald yes

1250
01:19:04,843 --> 01:19:07,974
I want to stay and watch
that's not gonna happen cruze

1251
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:10,817
now go
but mr. McQueen still has a chance

1252
01:19:10,842 --> 01:19:12,568
just go do your job

1253
01:19:13,566 --> 01:19:14,690
yes sir

1254
01:19:14,715 --> 01:19:18,087
and take off that spoiler and those racing
tires you look ridiculous

1255
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:22,089
you are a trainer, remember
not a racer! Not a race!

1256
01:19:23,622 --> 01:19:27,565
If you were racer, you know
what I'm talking about but you're not

1257
01:19:27,654 --> 01:19:28,881
so you don't

1258
01:19:32,566 --> 01:19:35,690
no no, she's not a race
she's a trainer.

1259
01:19:43,305 --> 01:19:49,070
I wanted to become a racer forever
because of you! You!

1260
01:19:51,273 --> 01:19:58,005
It was my one shot and I didn't take it
it was my one shot I didn't take it

1261
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:05,712
break in two! Break in turn two!
Hold on! Hold on!

1262
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,690
Kid, are you okay?

1263
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:23,219
Smokey, I need cruiz
never mind that now

1264
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:26,570
no, I'm here back here
now get her back

1265
01:20:26,595 --> 01:20:28,757
yellow flags still out there

1291
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:55,556
which makes it my last chance to give
you your first chance Cruz

1292

Now or Never

1296
01:22:11,869 --> 01:22:14,299
25 miles per hour fits me
I know that

1297
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:25,497
lightning McQueen's team has headed
a different car supporting the 95.

1298
01:22:25,522 --> 01:22:27,368
I don't believe what I'm seeing

1299
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:30,397
you're watching this right
what the girl in the costume

1302
01:22:49,889 --> 01:22:53,076

1305
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:01,029

1308
01:23:14,516 --> 01:23:18,089

1309
01:23:18,128 --> 01:23:19,419

oh, right... too tight.

1312
01:23:30,217 --> 01:23:32,739
I am a fluffy floud!
I am a fluffy floud!

1313
01:23:36,729 --> 01:23:39,863
You just pick the turns

1314
01:23:39,888 --> 01:23:41,345
no, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

1315
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:45,124
Tell her she's on a beach and all the little
crappie have gone night-night

1316
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:48,954
no ain't saying that
you tell her

1317
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:53,437
all right cruz the beach
I need you to think of the beach

1318
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:56,399

1320
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:05,623
all right, not too bad
this is nothing like the simulator

1321
01:24:05,964 --> 01:24:08,969
you got every toy in need
remember Thomasville.

1322
01:24:09,205 --> 01:24:11,429
Thomasville! Yeah,
sneak through the window

1323
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:14,979
now that, I understand
sneak through the window.

1324
01:24:33,091 --> 01:24:37,364
I am just learning that the racer replacing
McQueen is Cruz Ramirez

1325
01:24:37,426 --> 01:24:39,052
this is her very first race

1326
01:24:39,077 --> 01:24:42,940
actually Darrell, it says here she
does have one win under her belt

1327
01:24:42,971 --> 01:24:48,361
at a place called Thunder Hollow
Thunder Hollow! Thunder Hollow!

1328
01:24:50,403 --> 01:24:53,011

1329
01:24:53,185 --> 01:24:55,692

watch out that, you gotta go high

1330
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,599
go low! Go low!

1331
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,486
Nice job, you are smoking these guys

1343
01:25:50,873 --> 01:25:53,639

1344
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:56,925

1345
01:26:00,268 --> 01:26:02,870

1348
01:26:19,659 --> 01:26:21,769
Ramirez is in the third

1349
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:31,692
what are you doing storm?

1350
01:26:32,166 --> 01:26:34,819
Hey, costume girl

1351
01:26:34,864 --> 01:26:37,613

1352
01:26:37,652 --> 01:26:38,938

1353
01:26:38,963 --> 01:26:41,699
you look good
it's important to look the part that

1354
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,853
you can't have everyone thinking that
you don't deserve to be here

1355
01:26:44,892 --> 01:26:46,167
just trying to get in your head

1356
01:26:46,192 --> 01:26:49,124
they don't need to know
what you and I already do

1357
01:26:49,311 --> 01:26:54,860
that you can play dress-up all you
want but you'll never be one of us

1358
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:04,256

into his head don't you understand

1361
01:27:11,446 --> 01:27:14,911

1362
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:19,456

here travelling at your butt

1367
01:27:47,615 --> 01:27:52,145

about two june bugs on a summer night

1368
01:27:55,494 --> 01:27:57,566

1374
01:28:18,936 --> 01:28:22,350
You know, you can use that anger to push through
I said I'm not angry.

1375
01:28:23,492 --> 01:28:24,558
I don`t think so

1376
01:28:30,332 --> 01:28:34,328
cruz, get out of there!
You don't belong on this track

1377
01:28:35,961 --> 01:28:38,414
yes, I don`t.

1378
01:28:50,299 --> 01:28:53,062
I don`t believe it!
It's cruze Ramirez for the win

1379
01:28:53,087 --> 01:28:54,595
I didn`t expect this

1380
01:29:00,005 --> 01:29:01,805
cruz rameriz

1381
01:29:02,095 --> 01:29:03,628
