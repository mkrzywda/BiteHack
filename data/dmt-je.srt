2
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,548
Ah, the Heckler & Koch G-36.

3
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,800
Quite deadly
in the right hands.

4
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,074
Ah, Agent One.

5
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,163
I have been so looking forward
to this moment.

6
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:05,709
Well, in that case,
I'll try not to disappoint.

7
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:10,714
You overestimate your power
over women, Mr English.

8
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,676
I'd say that would be
virtually impossible.

9
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:31,068
Sir? Sir?

10
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,780
- Sir! Have you got them?

11
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,492
- Hmm?
- The mission documents.
Agent One's flying tonight.

12
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,996
Yes, the mission documents.
They're here somewhere. Ah, here we are.

13
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,584
Agent One.

14
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,461
Gentlemen.

15
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,469
I'm here for my documents.

16
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,722
Bough, Agent One's
documents, please.

17
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,311
- Thank you.

18
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,438
Your mission documents,
Agent One.

19
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:12,234
Including the codes for the submarine
hatch, which I've checked myself.

20
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,028
Thank you.

21
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:20,033
So, is it just France tonight,
or will you be slipping
over the Pyrenees as well?

22
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,829
If I told you that,
I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.

23
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:28,083
Oh.

24
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:33,463
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, I expect you would.

25
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,465
Cheerio, Agent One.

26
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,594
Bonne chance.
Arrivederci.

27
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:44,850
Such class.
Such distinction.

28
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,438
To: Ml7 All Depts. Urgent
Agent One killed in action in Biarritz.

29
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,025
Submarine hatch failed to open.

30
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:58,113
The greatest secret agent England's
ever had snuffed out in an instant.

31
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,991
Terrible.

32
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,953
Do you know what makes us envied
the world over, Bough?

33
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,832
- That there's always another
agent waiting to step in.
- Absolutely, sir.

34
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,211
And every last one of them
is gathered around that grave.

35
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:16,590
It is our honour and privilege
to guard them while they grieve.

36
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,636
Their lives
are in our hands, Bough.

37
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,980
Everything in order, English?

38
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,776
I think you'll find it's rather more
than just in order, sir.

39
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,780
You're now entering the most secure
location in the whole of England.

40
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,373
Pegasus,
we face a national crisis.

41
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,335
Agent One was clearly onto something,
and we have to find out what.

42
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,338
I need another agent on this.
Who else is there?

43
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,633
No one, Prime Minister.
They all died in the explosion.

44
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,969
All of them?

45
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,680
Well, luckily there is
one who survived.

46
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,056
Who?

47
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,475
## One eye on the shadows ## 

48
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,311
## Protecting his fellows ## 

49
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,398
- ## From sunup
till the moon on his back ## 

50
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,693
- ## Sendin' villains to Hades
A hit with the ladies ## 
- Johnny English.

51
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,029
## A stallion in the sack ## 

52
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:25,075
- ## You can't get your life back
when right follows left, Jack ## 

53
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,579
## The more you see
the less you know ## 

54
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:32,875
## When others would leak it
His service is secret ## 

55
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,628
## Plays God
when it's your time to go ## 

56
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,590
## Hey, fellas
Don't be jealous ## 

57
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,010
## When they made him
they broke the mould ## 

58
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:47,181
## So charismatic
with an automatic ## 

59
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,350
## Never prematurely
shooting his load ## 

60
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,311
Hah!

61
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,396
## Queen and country
safe and sound ## 

62
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,440
## With villains
six feet underground ## 

63
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,067
## And no one knows 'cause
no one's found any trace ## 

64
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,111
## Of a man for all seasons ## 

65
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,697
## Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone ## 

66
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,242
## So alone ## 

67
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:11,079
## And you and I wouldn't have a clue
who's doin' what, why, when and who ## 

68
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,207
## Up a creek with no canoe
Watch out ## 

69
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,792
## For the man
for all seasons ## 

70
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,712
## Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone ## 

71
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,672
## So alone ## 

72
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,886
- ## But safe at home ## 
- ## But safe at home ## 

73
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,431
- ## Oh, yeah, yeah ## 
- ## But safe at home ## 

74
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,142
## But safe at home
But safe at home ## 

75
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,983
## Then you and I wouldn't have a clue
who's doin' what, why, when and who ## 

76
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,237
## Up a creek with no canoe
Watch out ## 

77
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,531
## For the man
for all seasons ## 

78
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:49,326
## Loves 'em and leaves 'em
alone, so alone ## 

79
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,413
## But safe at home ##

80
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,459
Right.

81
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:01,463
Johnny English.
I'm here to see Pegasus.

82
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,716
Still, no sense
rushing things.

83
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,264
There are some items you need
to sign before your briefing.

84
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,267
This is your new
retinal I.D. Card,

85
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,436
and this is your level nine
security clearance.

86
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,648
Sign and date, please.

87
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,859
Ah.

88
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,529
Oh, reminds me of the old
service issue ballpoint.

89
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,991
I remember every agent would carry
a pen that looked just like this.

90
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,286
Completely innocent to the untrained
eye, but click it twice...

91
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,250
Ah, English, there you are.

92
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,253
Have you seen my secretary?

93
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,548
Um... she went out.

94
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:49,261
Um... shall we?

95
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,268
Now, Agent One believed that there was
a plot to steal the Crown Jewels.

96
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,438
They've recently been through
a multimillion-pound restoration,

97
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,648
largely paid for
by a corporate sponsor.

98
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,110
They're due to be unveiled
tonight at the Tower of London.

99
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:09,323
The queen is insisting that the ceremony
goes ahead, so what we want you to...

100
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,287
Hah! Who... Who...

101
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,956
Who is the sponsor, sir?

102
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,375
Pascal Sauvage.

103
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,378
What, that flouncy Frenchman
who owns a couple of prisons?

104
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,715
Sauvage's £7 billion empire,
English,

105
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,718
operates over 400 prisons
in 60 countries.

106
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,262
- He's built 25 of them here.
- Right, sir.

107
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,973
The man's related to the royal family,
for goodness’ sake.

108
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:39,978
As far as the prime minister's
concerned, he's one of the
greatest friends England's got.

109
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:45,651
Now, English, I want you at the Tower
tonight, monitoring this unveiling.

110
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,237
Any chink in security,
any weakness,

111
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,073
however slight,
must be plugged immediately.

112
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,534
Do we understand each other?

113
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,619
- Perfectly, sir.
- Good.

114
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,413
- Oh, yes.
- And, uh, English...

115
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:02,042
we can't afford any mistakes...
not tonight.

116
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,755
The word "mistake," sir, is not one
that appears in my dictionary.

117
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,424
THE TOWER OF LONDON

118
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,513
Fantastic car, sir!

119
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:28,068
Mr English, Colonel Sir Anthony
Chevenix, head of Royal Security.

120
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,070
Ah, Colonel,
good evening.

121
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,990
- Snipers posted on the roof
as per my request?
- Thirteen of them.

122
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,951
- Windows?
- Refitted with bullet-
and shatter-proof glass.

123
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,833
I shall now mingle
inconspicuously with the guests.

124
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,878
- Let me know when Her Majesty arrives.
- Very good.

125
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,547
Shall I mingle
with you, sir?

126
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,675
Oh, yes, Bough.
Once you've checked the roof.

127
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,449
Help! Help!

128
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,492
Well, hello.

129
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,495
Hello yourself.

130
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,373
Johnny English.

131
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,959
Lorna Campbell.

132
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,837
A Bloody Mary, please,
not too spicy.

133
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,466
So, are you here
in some professional capacity?

134
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,801
I worked on the restoration
of the jewels.

135
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,804
- Intriguing.
- And yourself?

136
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,517
If I told you that,
I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.

137
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,810
I'd like to see you try.

138
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,569
Monsieur Sauvage,
on behalf of Her Majesty,

139
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,863
may I welcome you
to the Tower.

140
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:57,407
Merci, monsieur.

141
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,243
So, are you here alone,
Mr English?

142
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,371
That's how I choose
to live my life, Miss Campbell.

143
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:07,125
Women want safety, security.
I can offer them nothing but danger.

144
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,003
Some women find danger
very attractive.

145
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,131
Women like you,
Miss Campbell?

146
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,011
Women like me
expect men like you...

147
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,264
to find that out
for yourself.

148
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,058
Hmm.

149
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,894
Madame.

150
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:30,440
Oh, it's for me, actually. Could your
rustle up some of those cheesy niblets?

151
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,901
Now, where were we?

152
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,821
You obviously haven't met
our host, Monsieur Sauvage.

153
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,990
No, thank God.

154
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:42,619
You know, I think I'd rather have
my bottom impaled on a giant cactus...

155
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,330
than exchange pleasantries
with that jumped-up Frenchman.

156
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:50,335
As far as I'm concerned, the only thing
the French should host is an invasion.

157
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:54,423
Sorry, can I help?

158
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,010
Pascal Sauvage,
jumped-up Frenchman.

159
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,096
Lorna Campbell. I've been so looking
forward to meeting you.

160
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,724
- Enchanté.

161
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,894
But of course! You're Johnny English.
I've heard all about you.

162
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:10,480
And between you and me,
I'm not so keen on the French myself.

163
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,442
But please
don't tell them that.

164
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,737
Let me go and search
for your nibbly cheese bits.

165
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,657
- No, no, no. L...
- I insist. The French are,
after all, fantastic waiters.

166
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,868
- The best in the world.
- Well... But-But...

167
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,996
- Wait here, and I will wait on you.
- No, really. There's no...

168
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,291
No. Please, please, please!

169
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,420
Hmm. Les Français.

170
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:38,717
Ils sont very...
n'est-ce pas?

171
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,860
Ladies and gentlemen,
mesdames est messieurs,

172
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:01,406
bienvenus, welcome tonight
to this wonderful occasion.

173
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,202
As we stand here
in the Tower of London,

174
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,371
the most famous prison
in the world,

175
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,916
where these wonderful
jewels will rest safely...

176
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,085
under lock and key,

177
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,879
I want to thank you...

178
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,132
for giving me
this wonderful experience...

179
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:23,637
to contribute to the restoration
of these jewels.

180
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,058
It was, as we say in France,
le top, le best of.

181
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,561
- And what a beautiful...

182
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:55,419
It's Colonel Chevenix! He's got
a nasty wound, sir. Who hit him?

183
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,964
The assailant.
He ran in here.

184
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,425
Bough, you guard the door.

185
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,053
Aha!

186
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,018
For God's sake, Bough, don't come in.
The man's a maniac!

187
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,313
- You don't frighten me!

188
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,565
- 
- Missed!

189
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:48,013
- 
- I've managed to subdue the assailant.

190
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,184
The panic's over.
Everything's under control.

191
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:56,063
-

192
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,899
Thank you. And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,735
we should compose ourselves
for the arrival of Her Majesty...

194
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,905
and return to the site
of our great nation's...

195
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:09,243
magnificently restored
Crown Jewels.

196
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,249
I know.
I feel it too.

197
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,709
The very symbols
of our island nation,

198
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,588
so close we could almost
reach out and...

199
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:27,010
- Pray silence
for Her Majesty the Queen.

200
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,055
Oh, where are the jewels?

201
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,349
It's an unmitigated disaster, English.

202
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,185
I couldn't agree more, sir.

203
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,897
Well, we need to get these
jewels back, English, and fast.

204
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:46,697
Tell me about this assailant.
When they searched the room,
there was no sign of him.

205
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,575
Well, the man was clearly
a professional.

206
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,744
He must have escaped while
the queen was being sedated.

207
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,747
But he's the only lead we've got.
We have to find him.

208
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:59,793
Come in. This is...
This is Roger from Data Support.

209
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,921
Please sit down. He'll produce
a likeness based on your description.

210
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,300
So tell us,
what did this man look like?

211
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,386
Um... well...

212
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,556
he was... big.

213
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,437
- Hair colour?
- Um... orange.

214
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,565
- Orange?
- Mmm. And curly.

215
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,277
Well, frizzy, actually.
Frizzy sort of thing.

216
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,821
- Frizzy.
- An eyepatch.

217
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:31,366
Broken nose.
Very few teeth.

218
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,702
Two, I would say,
at the most.

219
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,039
And a scar on his cheek...

220
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:41,376
in the shape... of a banana.

221
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,339
- Which cheek?
- Both cheeks.

222
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,217
They sort of met
in the middle.

223
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,018
Are you sure
about this, English?

224
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:02,397
Oh, yes, that's him.
An uncanny resemblance.

225
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:06,693
Why, it's just as if
he's in the room with us.

226
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:16,495
Wow! Look at this, sir.
Got all the bells and whistles.

227
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,456
Never mind about the gadgets.
Just focus on the case.

228
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,299
Oh, uh...

229
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,516
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you very much for waiting.

230
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,895
Now, the question that faces us
this morning is a simple one.

231
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:46,358
Namely, how did the thieves gain access
to this highly secure environment...

232
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,653
and then escape
with the jewels afterwards?

233
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:54,533
A simple question, but one
which I believe has a complex answer.

234
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,744
- Actually, sir...
- Uh, please, Bough. My mind is at work.

235
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,706
Now, what you must grasp, gentlemen,
is that the master criminal...

236
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:04,960
sees not a room
but a series of opportunities.

237
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,337
Should I go in
through the window?

238
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,339
Possibly.

239
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:13,760
- Should I drop down from the ceiling?
- Actually, sir...

240
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,598
There's one thing I think
we can be fairly confident about,

241
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,267
that is that they didn't
come up through the floor...

242
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,436
I've got you, sir.

243
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,230
That's all right.
Just come my way, Bough.

244
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,942
- That'll bring me
right over the hole, sir.
- There's no need to panic.

245
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,323
Can you see
the bottom yet, Bough?

246
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:37,242
Not yet, sir. The shaft
appears to be narrowing.

247
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,162
I'm just a little bit worried
I might get stuck.

248
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:44,416
Trust me, Bough. You won't
get stuck if you just keep moving.

249
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,169
Yes, sir.

250
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,088
I'm okay, sir.

251
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,549
Are you at the bottom
now, Bough?

252
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,052
No, I am in fact
stuck now, sir.

253
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,722
Oh, for God's sake, Bough.
Stay there! I'm coming down.

254
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,934
Uh, I'm not especially sure
that's a good idea, sir.

255
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,728
Don't worry.

256
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,272
Be careful, sir!

257
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,819
Gently does it.

258
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,531
- Sir?

259
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,454
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes. I landed on something quite soft.

260
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,207
- That was me, sir.
- Oh, good.

261
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,544
What now?

262
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:31,380
There's no way back
up there, that's for sure.

263
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,465
But this must lead
somewhere.

264
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,592
I'm slightly uncomfortable
in the dark, sir.

265
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,845
There's nothing
to worry about, Bough.

266
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,849
- It may be pitch black,
but we can still see.
- Can we, sir? How?

267
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,601
The Bedouin monks of
the Al Maghreb mountains...

268
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,020
developed a system
of sonic chanting.

269
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,731
- I see, sir.
- The sound of their chanting...

270
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,984
would bounce back
off any obstacles,

271
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,236
and using their
highly tuned ears...

272
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,072
they could paint a mental picture
of the path ahead.

273
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,200
- Brilliant, sir.
- However, you must always
sing in E-flat.

274
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:07,040
# E-flat, E-flat, E-flat #

275
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:11,837
# Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing #

276
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,548
- Is it working, sir?
- Extremely well, thank you, Bough.

277
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,550
# Thanks for all
the joy that... # 

278
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,510
- 
- Ow!

279
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,930
You all right, sir? I think
I can see something, sir.

280
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,433
Oh, yeah. Come on.

281
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,661
Here is the long one.

282
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,788
It is a long one.

283
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,832
Careful.

284
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,672
- I knew it.
- Shall we call for backup, sir?

285
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,593
What? And watch some fat-bottomed
bobby make our arrest for us?

286
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,595
I don't think so.

287
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:08,060
Good morning, gentlemen.
Ml7 at your service.

288
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:12,898
Observe, Bough, the dull
incompetence of the criminal mind.

289
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:17,069
It can never hope to match
our level of technical expertise.

290
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:06,285
- You've got it.
- What do we do now, sir?

291
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,370
Watch and learn, Bough.

292
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:16,253
- They're too far ahead of us.
- Have faith, Bough.
They're heading south.

293
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,431
- There they are, sir!
- Just as I thought.

294
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,479
- Hang on tight, Bough.

295
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,323
- We're never gonna catch them in this.

296
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,284
- Take the wheel, Bough.
I'm getting in the Aston.
- Sir?

297
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,082
Change places, Bough.
I'm getting out the other side.

298
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,084
Sir?

299
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,065
Set, Bough.
Take me up.

300
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,367
Swing me out, Bough!

301
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,457
- Whoa.
- Down.

302
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,422
- Up! Up!

303
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,053
Sorry!

304
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,224
Bough, pull out!

305
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,232
Ow! Ow!

306
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:04,194
Those idiots
are right behind us. Faster!

307
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,802
Uh-huh.

308
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:55,037
Drop me here, Bough!

309
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,460
Ow! Oh.

310
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,755
No! No! No!

311
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,174
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

312
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,379
They're turning into
the Brompton Cemetery.

313
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,841
Get here as soon as you can.
I'm going in.

314
00:25:55,848 --> 00:26:00,143
In a wheelchair. But Geoffrey
overcame these terrible disabilities...

315
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,939
with that simple resilience
and sunny optimism...

316
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,109
that so warmed
all of us who knew him,

317
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,528
spending the rest of his life
in the service...

318
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,489
of the poor and disabled
of this parish.

319
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:16,618
It's very good.
Really very good.

320
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:19,329
No, no, please go on.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

321
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,166
- It's very entertaining.
- Who's that?

322
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:27,129
That priest act of yours should keep the
other prisoners entertained for hours.

323
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,048
Oh, I'm so sorry. Where are
my manners? Johnny English,

324
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:33,260
British Secret Service,
and you are all under arrest.

325
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,888
I must say you've done
this whole thing very well.

326
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,473
The attention to detail
is excellent.

327
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,602
You, the grieving granny,
you're very convincing.

328
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:45,647
Oh, look. Real tears.
Do you get paid extra for that?

329
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:49,484
Ahh, what
we're all here for.

330
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:52,988
I know! Why don't we
take a look inside?

331
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:57,618
- 
- Oh, you've nailed it down!

332
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,037
Why would you do that?

333
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,917
I know you're gonna come back
in two weeks and dig it up again.

334
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:12,299
Now, what are you playing in this
little vignette of deceit and villainy?

335
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,426
I'm the hearse driver.

336
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,179
- You're the hearse driver?
- Yes, sir.

337
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,558
- You're the hearse driver?
- Yes, sir.

338
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:24,520
Ah! Aha!

339
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,940
There you are... Gunther.

340
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:32,152
Uh, I do hope he hasn't
made a nuisance of himself.

341
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,739
I'm Doctor, um...

342
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:42,538
Bough, of the Lunatic
Response Unit.

343
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:46,583
I'm afraid Gunther here wasn't
supposed to be released until 2028.

344
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,378
Isn't that right, Gunther?

345
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:53,757
Yes, yes, there's been
the most monumental cock-up.

346
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:58,178
Um, if you'll excuse me,
with the deepest respect,

347
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,472
utmost sympathy.

348
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:03,183
Uh, he hasn't urinated
on anyone, has he?

349
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,977
- No.
- No, no.

350
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,231
That's a blessing. Are you
gonna give me the gun, Gunther?

351
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:18,282
There. That wasn't
too difficult, was it?

352
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:22,452
- Are you going to come home now?

353
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,503
Oh... in the van!
Yes, we are going in the van.

354
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,881
Yes, yes.
Vroom, vroom.

355
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:37,050
- Vroom, vroom. Vroom, vroom.
- Yes. Yeah.

356
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:41,513
- Yes. He's waving good-bye.
Good-bye, everyone.

357
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,891
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Gunther.

358
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,727
Mind the nice dead people.
There we go.

359
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,694
Oh, we'll just go to the path
here. There. Big step.

360
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:59,072
It's a graveyard. It's
where they bring people...

361
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,241
Yes, all right.
You can stop now.

362
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:05,078
- For appearances,
I'll just hold your arm.
- Just keep walking.

363
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,539
In fact, run, run, run!

364
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:17,007
I can't believe
I've done this.

365
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,220
I mean, I really
cannot believe I've done this!

366
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,644
You see, 200 years ago,

367
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:33,565
my family should have inherited
the throne of England,

368
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:36,401
but they were cast aside.

369
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,738
Well, in a few
very short days,

370
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:42,950
it will be back
where it belongs.

371
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:48,080
With me.

372
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:53,502
Shall I try it on?
Yes? No? Maybe?

373
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:57,506
To make you king, we need
the archbishop of Canterbury to do that.

374
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,633
The archbishop of Canterbury...

375
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:03,637
is being taken care of
even as we speak.
TARGET ACQUIRED

376
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,807
TARGET LOCKED

377
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:19,111
There's only one thing, sir.
What are we going to do about English?

378
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:25,784
If I were you, I wouldn't worry
too much about English.

379
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:29,496
He is no threat to us.
I had his flat bugged.

380
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:59,234
Clearly, the aptly named
English is a fool.

381
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,863
He might be a fool, but he's
a fool who keeps showing up.

382
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:06,867
Well, the next time
he shows up,

383
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,994
eliminate him.

384
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,037
Thank you.

385
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,624
Dieter Klein
and Klaus Vendetta, sir.

386
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:17,503
Released from prison six months ago.
327 convictions between them.

387
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,630
Armed robbery,
grievous bodily harm...

388
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,007
and combined parking fines
of more than 400...

389
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,927
Uh, yes, all right. Thank you, Bough.
I think we get the picture.

390
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:28,180
The point is, sir,
that Vendetta and Klein...

391
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:31,642
are both in the employ
of Monsieur Sauvage.

392
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,728
- Pascal Sauvage?
- Precisely, sir.

393
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,564
But you're not suggesting
Sauvage is involved?

394
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,733
I think he's more
than just involved, sir.

395
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,194
I'm convinced he's
up to his French neck in it.

396
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,656
Don't be absurd. Sauvage
employs thousands of people.

397
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,867
Just because two of them
are villains doesn't mean that he is.

398
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:51,912
I want him discounted from this
investigation immediately.

399
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:53,914
Yes, sir.

400
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:02,089
All right. Tonight I shall be
at Sauvage's reception
for the new French ambassador.

401
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:04,842
Any developments,
you can reach me there.

402
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:08,345
Apart from that, I don't want you
within a hundred miles of the man.

403
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,389
Absolutely, sir.

404
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:14,393
Requisition order: Ml7 quartermasters
for immediate supply;

405
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:18,438
one military transport plane,
fully fueled, with permission
for nighttime city over flight;

406
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,985
two night camouflage parachutes,
plus reserves, plus neoprene
bodysuits, twice, in black.

407
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,237
I've never liked the navy blue.

408
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,699
And a 40-inch chest for me
'cause I need the sleeve length.

409
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,117
- Morning, Felch.
- Morning.

410
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,578
Oh, and two Special Forces
signet rings,

411
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,580
primed and colour-coded.

412
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:37,207
- What's all this for?
- For tonight's operation.

413
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,002
We're going to break into
Sauvage's headquarters.

414
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,379
- But Pegasus said...
- Let me worry about Pegasus.

415
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:46,675
I know that Sauvage
is behind all this, and tonight
we're going to get the evidence.

416
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:50,053
- Is something wrong, sir?
- Did that sound like Felch to you?

417
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:21,210
Bough...

418
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,267
You, upstairs.

419
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,242
Ow.

420
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,275
Can you see him, Bough?

421
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,486
He's on the upper level, sir.

422
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,785
Got him.

423
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:46,837
And like a coiled viper...
he strikes.

424
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:58,849
So what you're saying, sir,
is there must have been two of them?

425
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,143
Oh, at least, Bough.
Possibly four.

426
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,270
I wonder why
I didn't see them.

427
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,647
You mustn't dwell
on your mistakes.

428
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,984
- You must learn from them, then move on.
- Yes, sir.

429
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,946
- So where were you, sir?
- Just drop it, Bough!

430
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:19,995
- Aah! What is it, sir?
- That bike.

431
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:24,666
You get things
sorted out for tonight.

432
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:41,850
Well, well, we meet again.

433
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:44,436
Mr English.
What a pleasant surprise.

434
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,563
I wondered when
you might show up again.

435
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:51,068
On the contrary, Miss Campbell. It is
not I who keeps showing up. It's you.

436
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,529
Do you like sushi?

437
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,572
Hmm?

438
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,494
Oh, sushi! I practically
live off the stuff.

439
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:04,373
You might say the mysteries
of the Orient are no mystery to me.

440
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:16,760
- Sake?
- Ah. Sake.

441
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,721
Cheers.

442
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:24,977
May all your daughters
be born with three bottoms.

443
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:35,028
Now then, perhaps
you can explain how it is...

444
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:37,656
that I run into you
at two crime scenes...

445
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,326
and then can't find any record of you
on a single government computer.

446
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,954
Shouldn't you ask
the government that?

447
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,582
I am the government
and I'm asking you.

448
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:52,212
Let me.

449
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,133
Mmm. You're brave.

450
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:59,261
They say that sea urchin's
the ultimate acquired taste.

451
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:03,015
Hmm. It's a personal
favourite of mine.

452
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:11,023
I think people are put off
by how it feeds through its bottom.

453
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,317
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

454
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:35,255
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm from Ml7.
Sorry. I'm a secret agent.

455
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:56,401
- Everything set, Bough?
- Just about, sir.

456
00:37:56,485 --> 00:38:00,614
Actually, sir, do you mind if I
run through the plan one more time?

457
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:02,950
- No, no.
- These are the two buildings here.

458
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:07,454
This one is our target, Sauvage's
headquarters, next to City Hospital.

459
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:10,749
I jump first and land
on the south side of the roof,

460
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,961
abseil down 14 floors and
cut through this window here.

461
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:17,881
I then land on the east side
and abseil down 12 floors.

462
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:21,134
Where you wait for my signal
that I've disabled the alarm system.

463
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:23,679
- Yes.
- You them break into this window here,

464
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:26,431
work your way along the secure corridor
and penetrate Sauvage's office.

465
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,518
- Yes, yes.
- Is that okay, sir?

466
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,521
It's been okay ever since
I thought up the idea, Bough.

467
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,653
Oh, I nearly forgot, sir.
Your laser beacon.

468
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,656
- My what?
- Your laser beacon!

469
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,325
It'll guide you
onto Sauvage's building.

470
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,787
Your dependence on hardware
really does amuse me, Bough.

471
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:51,582
I've been dropped
into the Kalahari Desert...

472
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:56,003
carrying nothing more than a toothbrush
and a packet of sherbet lemons,

473
00:38:56,086 --> 00:39:00,257
and I still found my way
to Bulawayo before Ramadan.

474
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,178
So thank you, Bough,
but no thank you.

475
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,391
- Bough, go!

476
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,935
Geronimo!

477
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:42,257
- Fandango!

478
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:07,741
Ugh! Ai-yi-yi.

479
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,873
Right.

480
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:33,225
- Alarm's disabled, sir.

481
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,227
Roger that, Bough.

482
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:14,099
This is worse
than I thought, Bough.

483
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:18,228
Sauvage has got some kind
of laboratory set up here.

484
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:21,356
God knows what kind
of sick operation he's running.

485
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:36,622
My God, what
have they done to you?

486
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:39,917
They've taken
some of my blood.

487
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,378
- Bastards!
- It's only for tests.

488
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:46,215
Of course it is.
Come on, my friend.

489
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:49,384
Let's get you out of here
before they take anything else.

490
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:01,355
Ah! Good evening,
Dr Frankenstein.

491
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,440
This way, please.

492
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:06,276
Come on.
I haven't got all night.

493
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,238
And you,
you angels of death.

494
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,990
About turn.
Come on, let's go.

495
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:14,284
Come On, come On.
Keep moving.

496
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:17,788
Come on. Over there. I know
what you're doing here. And you.

497
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:20,916
Come on. Quicker. Quicker.
Over there.

498
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:25,087
Now then,

499
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,173
perhaps you could direct me
to your evil paymaster.

500
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:32,636
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

501
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,598
Where is the office
of Pascal Sauvage?

502
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:03,500
Are you coming over here
in a minute, sir?

503
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,504
I'm from Ml7.

504
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:10,424
This has been a test of your
emergency response systems,

505
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:13,635
and I have to say
you've all done extremely well.

506
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,805
Right.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

507
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:18,891
And, uh, get well soon.

508
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:28,317
Oh, God!

509
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:48,545
Sir. Sir.

510
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:58,388
Did you just land
on the wrong building?

511
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:02,226
I did a precautionary sweep
of the immediate environment.

512
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,311
Right.

513
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,814
- And everything was fine.
- Good.

514
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:10,025
Okay, let's go.

515
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:19,535
I will be downstairs
at the reception...

516
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:29,878
- That's far enough.
- Well, good evening.

517
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:33,048
- Perhaps you'd like this as well.
- What is it?

518
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,843
- Let me show you.
- Aah!

519
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:38,387
Well executed, Bough,
but completely redundant.

520
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,515
- How do you mean, sir?
- Super-strength muscle relaxant.

521
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:44,935
When he wakes up, he'll be
as floppy as a damp old sock.

522
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,651
What's this?

523
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:10,169
That's the face of
the archbishop of Canterbury.

524
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:16,008
What are they doing?

525
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:23,098
What's this got to do
with the Crown Jewels?

526
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:46,121
Bough.

527
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:05,057
English.

528
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,893
A people whose empire
once covered...

529
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,271
one quarter of the surface
of the earth.

530
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:13,649
Alas, no longer.

531
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:16,902
My friends ask me, "Pascal,
how can you be so interested...

532
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:21,073
in such a backward,
grotty little country?"

533
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:23,867
My answer is simple:
The queen.

534
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:27,746
The queen has more power
in her tiny white gloves...

535
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,250
than any other head of state
in the entire world.

536
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,627
She can declare war
or make peace,

537
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,963
and most intriguingly...

538
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:40,717
she can seize any piece of land
which takes her fancy.

539
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:44,513
Of course,
the queen never uses...

540
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:47,307
the enormous power
afforded to her.

541
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:51,895
But imagine someone
who would use that power.

542
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:55,482
Imagine, say, me.

543
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:59,611
But how could he do that, sir?
How could he make himself king?

544
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:01,780
The archbishop.

545
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:04,283
- 
-

546
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:13,041
Ow.

547
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:17,754
Hands up.
There's a good fellow.

548
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,631
Heavily armed for a late night
at the office.

549
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:24,011
You fool, English. You'll never
get out of the building alive.

550
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:26,305
I'd save your breath
for my questioning.

551
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:28,265
I'm not telling you
anything.

552
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,017
Incorrect.

553
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:33,103
Sodium pentothal.

554
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:36,565
- I won't lie to you. It's a truth serum.

555
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:41,195
Now then, why does Sauvage
want to have himself crowned?

556
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:44,448
You have no idea
what's going on here, do you?

557
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:47,534
It would be funny
if it wasn't so "pablibblit."

558
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:48,952
What?

559
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,878
- He's talking gibberish, sir.
- I can hear that.

560
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,841
- He's collapsed onto me, sir.
- I can see that.

561
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:06,220
- You don't think you could've
got the syringes mixed up?
- What?

562
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:09,139
Given the guard outside truth serum
and given Klein the muscle relaxant?

563
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:11,141
Aah!

564
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:15,521
Don't be ridiculous, Bough.
I think I know my right from my left.

565
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:18,607
- Sir?
- Oh, bugger it.

566
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,110
Bough, take "flodd."

567
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:26,156
- Take what, sir?
- "Flodd." "Schlage."

568
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,576
- I'm not quite getting
that second word, sir.
- "Schlaaaagh!"

569
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,578
- Write it down, sir.
- "Schlaaaagh!"

570
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:34,665
Yes!

571
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,418
"C." C-A... Uh...

572
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:42,256
Car! Take the car!
We came by plane.

573
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:45,092
Bugger off!

574
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:47,386
- Hold it right there.

575
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:50,848
- What's wrong with them?
- I'm not telling you.

576
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:53,725
Wrong answer.

577
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:55,978
What is it with you two?

578
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:58,272
Huh?

579
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:01,316
Let's get outta here.

580
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,277
Sorry, but who are you,
exactly?

581
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,988
Special Agent Campbell.
I'm attached to Interpol in Paris.

582
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:08,240
We've been watching Sauvage
for months.

583
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,242
Why?

584
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:13,412
Because every major convict released
from a Sauvage prison in six months...

585
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,664
has been employed
by one of his companies.

586
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:18,083
We believe he's recruiting them
for a major criminal conspiracy.

587
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,752
- We just don't know what yet.
-

588
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:24,298
- What did he say?
- Pegasus!

589
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:26,675
We have to report
to Pegasus!

590
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:28,677
Oh, no, sir.
No, no, no.

591
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,763
- How do we get out of here?
- Hey, you two!

592
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:34,516
What you did to me
really hurt.

593
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,854
Yeah. Sorry about that. How do we
get out of here without being seen?

594
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:41,607
Okay.

595
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:45,402
Left by the fountain, right by the fire
exit, to the elevator at the end.

596
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:47,821
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

597
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:49,573
Nice job, Bough.

598
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:52,451
- Left, sir. Left!

599
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,496
Sir, you can't go
to Sauvage's reception in this state.

600
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,373
The effect of the drug
has practically worn off.

601
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:00,334
I'm "fline"...

602
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:02,586
"schline"...
uh, "gline"...

603
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:14,723
- Monsieur.
- Ah. Thank you.

604
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:20,896
- Would you like another?
- Please.

605
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:28,779
Thank you.

606
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:35,994
What in God's name...

607
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,038
Ah, Foreign "Sebretarary."

608
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:40,582
Um...

609
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,501
Aah!

610
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:45,796
- Shall we dance?

611
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:36,638
Excuse me, sir.
I'm very sorry to interrupt...

612
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,765
Pascal, how nice
to see you again.

613
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:41,393
- Enjoying the party?
- Oh, splendid affair.

614
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:46,356
I was until I was informed
that your man English...

615
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,276
and his curious boyfriend here
have spent the evening...

616
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,779
breaking into my office
and assaulting my staff.

617
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,991
- Is this true, Bough?
- Well, we... we...

618
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:08,212
What do you think
you're up to?

619
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:11,048
- Sir, if I could just offer...
- Go home, Bough!

620
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,883
Now!

621
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:15,511
I gave you direct orders
not to meddle with Sauvage.

622
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:18,889
What do you do? Break into his office
and assault two of his staff.

623
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:23,227
Then you march in here,
loaded with God knows what,
and insult the foreign secretary.

624
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,021
I haven't encountered such
behaviour in Whitehall in 30 years.

625
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:28,899
- But...
- There are no "buts," English.

626
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:32,444
You're off the case. Your security
clearance is hereby cancelled.

627
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:35,781
After a three-month leave of absence,
you will return at your old grade.

628
00:52:35,864 --> 00:52:38,867
And I hope never
to hear your name again.

629
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,795
English has seen too much.

630
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:34,298
We go to plan "B."

631
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,675
Get rid of
the fake archbishop...

632
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,595
and green-light
the visit to Her Majesty.

633
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:43,348
Then this pathetic country
can humiliate itself...

634
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:45,976
by crowning me officially.

635
00:53:57,196 --> 00:54:01,241
THE QUEEN'S RESIDENCE
AT SANDRINGHAM

636
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,003
That's a letter
of abdication...

637
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:15,005
renouncing your claims
to the throne...

638
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,050
and the claims
of your entire family.

639
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,052
Sign it.

640
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:29,770
Never.

641
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:43,909
- Yes?

642
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:46,954
Prime Minister, sorry to call so late,
but I'm afraid the queen is abdicating.

643
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:48,664
What?

644
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:52,960
Abdicated?
But that's not possible.

645
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:55,170
I only wish that were true.

646
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:59,216
- Let me talk to her. Maybe she just...
- Pascal, she's gone.

647
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:01,927
My people have spent
the last 10 hours...

648
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,472
trying to track down
the rightful heir to the throne...

649
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:08,642
and they've come up with a name,
which they've double-checked.

650
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:11,145
Who is it?

651
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:14,231
- It's you.
- No!

652
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:21,321
In the wake
of the return of the Crown Jewels...

653
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:23,365
to a police station
in North London,

654
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:26,118
Pascal Sauvage has requested
that his coronation...

655
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,620
take place
this Thursday.

656
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:32,499
In the House, the prime minister said he
was looking forward to the ceremony...

657
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:35,002
and he believed that Monsieur Sauvage
will make a fine king...

658
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:39,715
and will bring all that is
best about modern Europe
to our ancient institutions.

659
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,516
Get your car keys.
We've got work to do.

660
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,603
- Miss Campbell.
- Sauvage is heading back to France.

661
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:57,191
He's invited 13 of
the richest criminal masterminds
in the world to meet him there.

662
00:55:57,274 --> 00:56:00,569
I'm sorry, Miss Campbell.
I'm off the case.

663
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:02,196
It's been reassigned.

664
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:04,823
I know.
Reassigned to me.

665
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:10,913
- I want you with me.
- Just leave me alone.

666
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:14,666
Are you gonna sit here in this
grotty flat feeling sorry for yourself?

667
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,836
Or are you gonna get out there
and save your country?

668
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:21,256
I'm gonna sit in the flat.

669
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:25,260
- Johnny, this is ridiculous.
- I'm a spent force.

670
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:29,640
Spent, my ass.

671
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:36,104
Ow.

672
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:39,691
Will... you...
please... stop?

673
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,081
I'll just be a minute.

674
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,477
NORTHERN FRANCE

675
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:40,961
It'll be nightfall in an hour.
Then we can strike out for the chateau.

676
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:44,173
The fact is, the moment Sauvage
gets that crown on his head,

677
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:47,384
he'll be able to do whatever he likes
with the country that I love,

678
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:50,095
and that is why you and I
have got to stop him.

679
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:55,350
- Relishing the thought?
- Something like that.

680
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:01,773
I suppose you've made love
to lots of women, haven't you, Johnny?

681
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:08,030
Uh...
Uh, well, you know,

682
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:10,699
one does one's best.

683
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,869
It's just...

684
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:18,790
Well, it's been three years
since my fiancé left me,

685
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:22,544
and since then I haven't
made love to anyone.

686
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:24,463
But then I met you...

687
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:28,592
and I felt this...
hunger...

688
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:31,762
deep down inside.

689
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:34,932
I wanted to say things to you,
I wanted to do things to you...

690
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:39,394
that I haven't wanted to do
in a very, very, very long time.

691
00:58:43,232 --> 00:58:45,984
What, uh...

692
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:48,821
What sort of things
are we talking about?

693
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:51,698
Things like
punching you in the face,

694
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:54,993
kicking you in the backside for being
such a pompous, know-nothing asshole.

695
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:59,206
But then I started to see beyond
the idiot that everybody else saw.

696
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:02,209
I started to see
the man on the inside...

697
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:06,255
who was determined to do his duty,
no matter what or who lay in his way.

698
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:10,133
And I began to feel
other things for him,

699
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:14,847
to want to do
other things for him.

700
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,307
Things...

701
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:21,019
involving plastic toys
and soft cheese?

702
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:25,607
- What?
- What? What?

703
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:29,987
You're toying with me.
You're telling me to stop in
the gentlest way you know how.

704
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,030
No. N-N-No...

705
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:33,740
You're such a special person...

706
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:36,910
not to take advantage of me
while I'm vulnerable.

707
00:59:36,994 --> 00:59:39,413
- N-No... Well...
- So thank you...

708
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:41,707
for being such a gentleman.

709
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:46,336
Not at all.

710
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:10,194
I know what you're thinking,
Miss Campbell.

711
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,030
If we don't pull this off, God knows
what might happen to England.

712
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:16,366
Actually, I was thinking there must be
a better way in than that pipe.

713
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,495
Well, there isn't.

714
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:22,498
I've analysed it from every angle,
and this is the best option.

715
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:26,210
I'll go in first, and if it's a clear
way through, I'll call down.

716
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:29,838
Johnny.

717
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:33,091
- Be careful.
- I'm always careful.

718
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:34,968
Ohh.

719
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:25,769
- Gentlemen.

720
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:27,646
In a few hours time...

721
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:30,315
I will become
the next king of England.

722
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:49,501
Oh, no.

723
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:06,101
Hyah...

724
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:08,937
- How did you get here?
- Up the ladder.

725
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:11,440
Pull yourself together.
It's only a bit of poo.

726
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:18,530
Oh! Oh, it's cold!
It's cold!

727
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,657
What is the one commodity...

728
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:25,412
the world never seems
to run out of?

729
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:27,539
Criminals, gentlemen.

730
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,833
- 
- Lawbreakers.

731
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:33,504
Every nation in the world
struggles...

732
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:36,215
with the issue
of overcrowded prisons.

733
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:41,428
So, what do we do
with all these villains?

734
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:44,431
Find the solution
to that problem...

735
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:48,685
and the governments of the world
would pay you through their nose.

736
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:52,689
Fortunately,
I have found a solution.

737
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:58,779
We empty every prison
on the entire planet,

738
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:03,700
we take the resulting
tidal wave of human scum...

739
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:06,328
and we put it here.

740
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:13,085
The moment
I am crowned king,

741
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,754
I will turn England
into the largest prison...

742
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:18,632
in the history
of the world.

743
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,345
210,000 square miles...

744
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:25,472
of prime real estate...

745
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:29,143
conveniently separated
from true civilization...

746
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:31,353
by 20 miles of ocean...

747
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,605
- and soon to be available...
- Come on.

748
01:03:33,689 --> 01:03:39,403
For the entire world
to dump its human waste in.

749
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,488
According to
current projections,

750
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:47,244
we will not run out of prison space
for the next 500 years.

751
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:51,248
So, tonight one,
and only one, of you...

752
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:56,211
will leave here
owning 49 percent...

753
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:58,589
of this venture.

754
01:03:58,714 --> 01:04:03,427
So that's his little game.
We must get hold of that DVD.

755
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,471
But how, Johnny?
There's only two of us.

756
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:08,724
You're young, Miss Campbell,
and inexperienced.

757
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:11,059
What you seem to
have forgotten is that...

758
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:14,438
Nobody knows we are here.

759
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:17,900
At our disposal we have
the vital element of surprise.

760
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:20,944
Now, my plan is simple
but effective.

761
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:25,407
I shall drop from the gallery
at this end of the room
and take Sauvage prisoner.

762
01:04:25,491 --> 01:04:29,953
You will then enter from the far door,
cutting off any means of escape.

763
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:35,250
Then, using Sauvage as a hostage,
we'll get the hell out of here. Clear?

764
01:04:42,466 --> 01:04:44,635
Get 'em up,
you French ponce.

765
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,097
But, Mr English,
I'm gobsmacked!

766
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:51,558
What an unexpected surprise.

767
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:55,145
Surprises are very much
my speciality, Sauvage.

768
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:59,024
I think we've seen
enough of this.

769
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:05,656
I know exactly what you're planning,
and I'm here to put a stop to it.

770
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:10,285
My bottom will be king of England
before you are.

771
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:12,287
Wrong again.

772
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:15,457
Perhaps you'd care
to look behind you.

773
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,751
Oh, please.

774
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:22,756
Lorna!

775
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:27,469
I'm sorry, Johnny.

776
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:31,306
Well, I'm afraid
that we'll have to...

777
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:33,976
conclude the floor show
for tonight.

778
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:35,811
Not so fast, Sauvage.

779
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:40,232
You may have taken me,
but you'll never take England.

780
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:42,985
Not as long as I have
breath in my body...

781
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:45,237
or a bullet in my gun.

782
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:58,500
You know, Mr English,
I'm going to miss you. Really.

783
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:00,711
You're very entertaining.
I thank you.

784
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:02,421
Take them away.

785
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:08,552
Good morning, everybody,

786
01:06:08,677 --> 01:06:10,721
and welcome to
the breakfast show.

787
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:16,143
As the crowds are gathering here for
the crowning of our first French king...

788
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:18,270
since the year 1066,

789
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:23,108
call here at London FM with the top ten
things you most love about the French.

790
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:26,487
We haven't had
any calls yet, uh, at all,

791
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:29,990
but the lines are still open
and I'll give you that number again...

792
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:33,035
0- 2-0-7...
zero, deux, zero, sept...

793
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,748
This is not good,
Johnny.

794
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:39,875
We've got to think
of something.

795
01:06:41,585 --> 01:06:44,713
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

796
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:46,340
Hop! Hop!

797
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:50,010
And hop! And hop!
And stop!

798
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,471
Now, are you familiar...

799
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:56,099
with the shaman throat warblers
of the Guatemalan delta?

800
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:57,518
What?

801
01:06:57,559 --> 01:06:59,478
It has long been
their belief...

802
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:03,440
that a whistle pitched at the precise
resonant frequency of a metal lock...

803
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:07,444
will vibrate the levers in such a way
that the door will simply swing open.

804
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,321
Unbelievable.

805
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:12,241
- And kneel.

806
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:17,913
Right. Here goes.

807
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:32,970
- I can't hear anything.
- I'm into ultrasonic.

808
01:07:33,053 --> 01:07:35,848
Will you just stop all this
and face facts?

809
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:39,518
We've failed. The only thing
that can save us now is a miracle.

810
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:47,734
It worked!

811
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:50,445
- Ohh!
- Sir?

812
01:07:58,328 --> 01:08:01,248
I don't know why you hauled yourself up
that dreadful poo tube, Bough,

813
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:04,960
when there was a perfectly good ladder
right beside it.

814
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:07,379
Now, Sauvage may have
fooled the country...

815
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:10,090
with his fake archbishop
and his secret agenda,

816
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:12,467
but he hasn't fooled me.

817
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,263
- So, here's the plan.

818
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:12,444
## Let all good people
rejoice ## 

819
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:16,031
## Rejoice ## 

820
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:19,535
- ## Rejoice ## 
- Aaah!

821
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:23,372
## Let all good people
rejoice ## 

822
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,459
## Rejoice ## 

823
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:28,919
## Rejoice ## 

824
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:32,422
## Rejoice ## 

825
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:34,925
## Rejoice ## 

826
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:37,469
## Rejoice ## 

827
01:09:37,553 --> 01:09:43,350
## And sing ##

828
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:47,271
Sirs, you are hereby called
to witness the anointing...

829
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:53,360
of your one true lord
and future king Pascal.

830
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:57,322
Pascal, are you willing
to take the oath?

831
01:09:57,406 --> 01:10:00,701
I am willing.

832
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:04,121
Then be thou anointed...

833
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:07,833
with this holy oil.

834
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:14,298
And do you, the chosen bishops
of England, Scotland and Wales,

835
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:17,092
ascent to this anointing?

836
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:19,595
For Scotland, I do.

837
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,346
For Wales, I do.

838
01:10:22,222 --> 01:10:25,142
For England, I do not!

839
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:28,812
-
- English!

840
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:35,486
That man must not be crowned king
because he is...

841
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:38,238
a fraudster, a charlatan
and a thief.

842
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:41,825
No, please.
Let him speak.

843
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:46,455
It is this man,
Pascal Sauvage,

844
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:49,625
who stole the Crown Jewels,

845
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:51,835
who forced the queen
to abdicate...

846
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:55,672
and who would kill anyone
who got in his way.

847
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:57,633
It is the end,
Herr English.

848
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:02,596
He has cheated,
conned and manipulated...

849
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:05,349
this great country
for his own ends.

850
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:07,643
He's fooled you all!

851
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:12,898
What's more,
this whole ceremony is a sham...

852
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:16,401
because that man
standing in front of you...

853
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:19,530
is not the archbishop
of Canterbury.

854
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:25,577
English, a word of advice:
Don't go there.

855
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:29,998
Shut it, Frenchy. I'll go
wherever I damn well please.

856
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:33,460
- Now take it off.
- What?

857
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:36,755
Your face
is made of plastic.

858
01:11:38,382 --> 01:11:40,259
Remove it at once.

859
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:42,719
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

860
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:46,682
Right. I'll just have to
remove it myself.

861
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:50,811
Come On!

862
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:54,064
- Maybe it pulls up from the front.
-

863
01:11:54,148 --> 01:11:56,483
Come on, you!

864
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:13,667
- Aaah!
- Thank you very much.

865
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:17,337
Must be a join here
somewhere.

866
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:20,215
Fascinating performance
as always, Monsieur English,

867
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:22,801
but I'm afraid
we must move on.

868
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:27,097
Nobody's moving anywhere until I'm
finished with this piece of low-life.

869
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:30,100
Do you or do you you not...

870
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:33,270
have tattooed on your bottom
the words,

871
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:36,231
"Jesus is coming...
look busy"?

872
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:40,235
-
- Are you insane?

873
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,446
Well, let's find out,
shall we?

874
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:45,115
Go on, over.
Let's have a look.

875
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,084
- Excellent!

876
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,931
All right, so I was wrong
about the archbishop's bottom.

877
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,352
- But there's more.
- But not, I'm afraid, today.

878
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:15,771
Sergeant, please
take this man away.

879
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:19,399
- But be gentle with him.
- Do you think that's it?

880
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:21,819
You think I don't have
more evidence?

881
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:25,197
My loyal subordinate
is standing by with a DVD...

882
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,784
which shows Sauvage's
hideous plans for this country.

883
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:30,994
Get him out!
Get him out of here!

884
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:34,748
- Play it, Bough! Play the disk!
- Play it! Now!

885
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:53,642
- ## You're so hot teasing me ## 

886
01:13:53,725 --> 01:13:59,565
## So you're blue, but I can't
take a chance on a chick like you ## 

887
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:02,818
## It's somethin'
I couldn't do ## 

888
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,948
## Well, I can dance with you, honey
if you think it's funny ## 

889
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:10,701
## Does your mother know
that you're out ## 

890
01:14:10,784 --> 01:14:14,329
## And I could shout with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe ## 

891
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:17,416
## Does your mother know
that you're out ## 

892
01:14:17,499 --> 01:14:20,085
- ## Take it easy ## 
- ## Take it easy ## 

893
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:22,462
## Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go ## 

894
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:25,883
## Does your mother know ## 

895
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:35,309
- Oi!
- Hey!

896
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,235
Well, shall we?

897
01:14:51,575 --> 01:14:54,745
Then as Solomon was anointed king...

898
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:58,957
by Zadok the priest
and Nathan the prophet,

899
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:02,377
so be thou anointed...

900
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:04,296
and consecrated king...

901
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:09,468
over all the peoples...

902
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:11,470
whom the Lord thy God...

903
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,890
hath given thee to govern...

904
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:18,227
and of all your possessions,

905
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,145
wherever they may be.

906
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:24,399
And so,
in the name of the Father...

907
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:26,109
and of the Son...

908
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:28,070
and of the Holy Ghost,

909
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:32,199
I crown you...

910
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:38,372
Damn it!

911
01:15:38,455 --> 01:15:40,457
- Give it back!
- NO!

912
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:42,376
- That is my crown!
- Never!

913
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:45,838
- Give it back!
- Never in a million years, Sauvage!

914
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,798
- Give it to me!
- Get off.

915
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:50,509
Merde!

916
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:54,179
Give it back!

917
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:57,724
- Stop!
- Shut up!

918
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,438
All this stupid little country
have to do is stand in line...

919
01:16:03,522 --> 01:16:07,693
and do what it's told
for one miserable day!

920
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:10,445
But can it do that?

921
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:12,948
My fragrant French ass,
it can!

922
01:16:17,536 --> 01:16:20,038
Merde!

923
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:23,417
- Aah!

924
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,629
Give it! The crown, eh?
The crown! Go!

925
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:34,845
And so, in the name
of the Father...

926
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:37,306
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost,

927
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:39,933
I crown you...

928
01:16:42,811 --> 01:16:44,605
king.

929
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:46,690
What...

930
01:17:12,549 --> 01:17:15,511
Arrest that man...

931
01:17:15,594 --> 01:17:17,638
and lock him away.

932
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:26,063
# God save the king
Long live the king #

933
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:28,732
## God save the king ## 

934
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:37,574
## Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen ## 

935
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:48,710
## Ahh, amen, amen
Amen, hallelujah ## 

936
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:50,838
## Amen ## 

937
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:02,975
## God save the king ##

938
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:07,729
Words can hardly express just how much
we appreciate everything you've done.

939
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:10,149
Nothing more
than my duty, ma'am.

940
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:15,154
And in return, is there anything that
your queen and country can do for you?

941
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,322
Well,

942
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:21,243
since one is asking,
ma'am...

943
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:24,413
In celebration
of her return to the throne,

944
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:27,416
the queen has declared August 5
a national holiday...

945
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:31,920
and has conferred a knighthood
on the unnamed Ml7 agent...

946
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:36,008
responsible for foiling the plot
of French businessman Pascal Sauvage.

947
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:38,594
Mr Sauvage is now awaiting trial
for high treason,

948
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,846
a crime which still
carries the death penalty.

949
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:45,225
If found guilty, he's asked that his
brain be donated to medical science...

950
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:49,146
to further research into the causes
of hyper manic schizophrenia.

951
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:51,648
Meanwhile, the unnamed English agent
has left the country...

952
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:54,776
and has already embarked
on his next challenging mission.

953
01:18:57,571 --> 01:19:00,491
SOMEWHERE
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE

954
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:02,743
Sir Johnny English.

955
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:05,579
Her Majesty
did seem very grateful.

956
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:09,208
She's not the only one.

957
01:19:17,508 --> 01:19:20,636
Mmm. You are
full of surprises.

958
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:28,060
Aaaah!

959
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:31,647
- Johnny!
- Oh, f...

960
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:34,274
## One eye on the shadows ## 

961
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,276
## Protecting his fellows ## 

962
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,321
## From sunup
to the moon on his back ## 

963
01:19:39,404 --> 01:19:43,534
## Sendin' villains to Hades
A hit with the ladies ## 

964
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:47,287
## A stallion in the sack ## 

965
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:51,041
## You can't get your life back
when right follows left, jack ## 

966
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:54,670
## The more you see
the less you know ## 

967
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:58,257
## When others would leak it
his service is secret ## 

968
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:01,301
## Plays God
when it's your time to go ## 

969
01:20:01,385 --> 01:20:06,390
## Hey, fellas
Don't be jealous ## 

970
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:09,393
## When they made him
they broke the mould ## 

971
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:12,437
## So charismatic
with an automatic ## 

972
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:17,359
## Never prematurely
shooting his load, ha ## 

973
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:19,361
## Queen and country
safe and sound ## 

974
01:20:19,444 --> 01:20:21,196
## With villains
six feet underground ## 

975
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,074
## And no one knows 'cause
no one's found any trace ## 

976
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:26,493
## Of a man for all seasons ## 

977
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:29,621
## Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone ## 

978
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:32,416
## So alone ## 

979
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:34,209
## And you and I
wouldn't have a clue ## 

980
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:36,295
## Who's doin' what, why
when and who ## 

981
01:20:36,378 --> 01:20:38,088
## Up a creek with no canoe ## 

982
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:41,341
## Watch out for
the man for all seasons ## 

983
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:44,344
## Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone ##

But safe at home ##
