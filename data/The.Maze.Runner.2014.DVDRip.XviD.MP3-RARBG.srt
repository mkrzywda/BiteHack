Play one of the best new FPS shooters,
search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK

2
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,099
Hello?

3
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,179
Hello?

4
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:30,027
Hey! Hey! Help me!

5
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,330
Go get him.

6
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,671
Day one, Greenie.

7
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,040
Rise and shine.

8
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,247
He looks like a slopper to me.

9
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,214
I could use some help in the kitchen.

10
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,948
Hey, we got a runner!

11
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,571
Take it all in.

12
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,778
He's all yours.

13
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:36,952
Hey.

14
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,258
Hey there, Green Bean.

15
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,761
You're not gonna run again. Okay?

16
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,432
Good.

17
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,446
My name is Alby.

18
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,382
Can you tell me anything
about yourself? Who you are?

19
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,480
Where you came from? Anything at all.

20
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,618
No.

21
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,425
Can you tell me your name?

22
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,937
I can't remember anything.

23
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,297
- Why can't I remember anything?
- lt's okay.

24
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,606
Hey, relax.

25
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,968
Relax.

26
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,504
It's normal.

27
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,276
It happens to us all.

28
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,487
You'll get your name back
in a day or two.

29
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,084
It's the one thing they let us keep.

30
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,490
What is this place?

31
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,732
Let me show you.

32
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,740
We eat here.

33
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,244
We sleep here.

34
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,384
We grow our own food.
We build our own shelter.

35
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,049
Whatever we need, the Box provides.
The rest is up to us.

36
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,382
The Box?

37
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,095
Yeah. lt's sent up once a month
with fresh supplies and a new Greenie.

38
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,855
This month that's you.

39
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,330
Congratulations.

40
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,199
Sent up? By who, though?
Who put us here?

41
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,662
That, we don't know.

42
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,241
Hey, are you all right, Alby?

43
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,068
Green Bean, meet Newt.

44
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,008
When I'm not around, he's in charge.

45
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,829
It's a good thing you're
always around then.

46
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,009
That was some dash you made earlier.

47
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,054
For a second, I thought
you had the chops to be a runner...

48
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,850
...till you face-planted.

49
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,318
That was great.

50
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,381
Wait, a "runner"?

51
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,119
Newt, do me a favor. Go find Chuck.

52
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,563
- All right.
- Thanks.

53
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,633
Look, I'm sorry to rush this.

54
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,896
You came up a little late,
and there's a lot to do.

55
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,540
We got something special planned tonight.

56
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,865
Yeah. You'll see.

57
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,574
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

58
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,774
Let's go. Come on.

59
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,152
This is all we got.

60
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,156
We've worked hard for it.

61
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,127
If you respect this place...

62
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,826
you and I will get along just fine.

63
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,492
What's out there?

64
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,709
We only have three rules.

65
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,274
First, do your part.

66
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,950
No time for any freeloaders.

67
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,785
Second, never harm another Glader.

68
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,358
None of this works unless we have trust.

69
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,455
Most importantly...

70
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,896
never go beyond those walls.

71
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,661
Do you understand me, Greenie?

72
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,401
Hey, Alb'!!!

73
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,968
Hey, Chuck. Where you been, man?

74
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,246
It's basically the same story
for all of us.

75
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,486
We wake up in the Box,
Alby gives us the tour...

76
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,982
then here we are.

77
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,827
Don't worry.

78
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,362
You're already doing better than I did.

79
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,327
I clunked my pants three times
before they got me out of the pit.

80
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,468
No, come on.

81
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,013
Dude, where are you going?

82
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,548
I just wanna see.

83
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,786
You can look around all you want
but you better not go out there.

84
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,413
Why not? What's through there?

85
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,220
I don't know. I just know what I'm told.

86
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,417
And we're not supposed to leave.

87
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,036
Hey, Chuck. New Greenie?

88
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,335
How does it feel to be promoted?

89
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,773
Feels great, Ben.

90
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,339
I thought no one was allowed to leave.

91
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,278
I said we're not allowed to leave.

92
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,784
They're different, they're runners.
They know more about the maze than anyone.

93
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,148
Wait, what?

94
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,548
What?

95
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,587
What? You just said "maze."

96
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,555
I did?

97
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,749
Yeah.

98
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,130
Where are you going? What are you doing?

99
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,494
L'm just gonna take a look.

100
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:46,731
I told you, you can't.
No one leaves, especially not now.

101
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,168
It's not safe.

102
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,734
Okay, all right, I'm not gonna go.

103
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,541
Hey!

104
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,222
We gotta stop meeting like this, Greenie.

105
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,759
- Get off me!
- All right! Calm, calm, calm.

106
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,590
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy!

107
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:12,819
Just relax.

108
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,626
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

109
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,825
Just calm down, all right?

110
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,959
No, okay?
Why won't you tell me what's out there?

111
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,560
- We're just trying to protect you.
- lt's for your own good.

112
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,729
You guys can't just keep me here.

113
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,830
- I can't let you leave.
- Why not?

114
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,755
What the hell?

115
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,379
Next time, I'm gonna let you leave.

116
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,685
Welcome to the Glade.

117
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,568
Light him up!

118
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,829
Hell of a first day, Greenie.

119
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,703
Here.

120
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,377
Put some hair on your chest.

121
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,819
Oh, my God! What is that?

122
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,695
I don't even know.

123
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,457
It's Gally's recipe.

124
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,891
It's a trade secret.

125
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,670
Yeah, he's still an asshole.

126
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,303
He saved your life today.

127
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,846
Trust me. The maze is a dangerous place.

128
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,755
We're trapped here, aren't we?

129
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,654
For the moment.

130
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,587
But...

131
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,098
you see those guys?

132
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,991
There, by the fire?

133
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,561
Those are the runners.

134
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,703
That guy in the middle there,
that's Minho.

135
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,301
He's the Keeper of the Runners.

136
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:16,141
Every morning, when those doors open,
they run the maze...

137
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,613
mapping it, memorizing it,
trying to find a way out.

138
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,977
How long have they been looking?

139
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,217
Three years.

140
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,151
And they haven't found anything?

141
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,321
It's a lot easier said than done.

142
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,158
Listen.

143
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,428
Hear that?

144
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,731
It's the maze, changing.

145
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,902
It changes every night.

146
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,847
How is that even possible?

147
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,007
You can ask the people who put us in here,
if you ever meet the bastards.

148
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,851
Listen, the truth is...

149
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,118
the runners are the only ones
who really know what's out there.

150
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,492
They are the strongest
and the fastest of us all.

151
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,552
And it's a good thing, too...

152
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,690
because if they don't make it back
before those doors close...

153
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,291
then they are stuck out there
for the night.

154
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,435
And no one has ever survived
a night in the maze.

155
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,470
What happens to them?

156
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,418
We call them Grievers.

157
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:34,319
Of course, no one's ever seen one
and lived to tell about it.

158
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,886
But they're out there.

159
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,834
Right, that's enough questions
for one night. Come on.

160
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,563
You're supposed to be the guest of honor.

161
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,902
No! No, come on.
Let me show you around.

162
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,801
Come on.

163
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,050
And there we got the builders.

164
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,586
They're very good with their hands...

165
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,645
but not a lot going on upstairs.

166
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,818
And then we got Winston...

167
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,992
he's the Keeper of the Slicers.

168
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,593
And we got two med-jacks, Clint and Jeff.

169
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,391
- Hey, what's up?
- Yo, Newt.

170
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,554
They spend most of their time
bandaging up the slicers.

171
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,633
What if l want to be a runner?

172
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,765
Have you listened to a word I've just said?
No one wants to be a runner.

173
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,899
And, besides, you gotta get chosen.

174
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,238
Chosen by who?

175
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,744
What do you say, Greenie?

176
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,581
Wanna see what you're made of?

177
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,520
Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!

178
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,233
Okay. All right.

179
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,110
The rules are simple, Greenie.

180
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,476
I try to push you out of the circle...

181
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,776
you try to last more than five seconds.

182
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,976
Take it easy on the Greenie.

183
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,040
Ready?

184
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,552
Get up, boy.

185
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,990
Come on, Greenie. We're not done yet.

186
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,190
Stop calling me Greenie.

187
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,494
Stop calling you that?

188
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,899
What do you wanna be called? Shank?

189
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,640
What do you think, boys?
Does he look like a Shank?

190
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,039
Come on!

191
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,310
You know what?
I think I've settled on Shank.

192
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,523
There you go, Greenie!

193
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,366
Not bad for a Greenie, huh?

194
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,102
Thomas.

195
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,139
Thomas. Hey!

196
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,474
Thomas!

197
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,423
I remember my name. I'm Thomas!

198
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,449
Thomas!

199
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,689
Welcome home, Thomas.

200
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,003
Good job... Thomas.

201
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,382
What the hell was that?

202
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,858
That, my friend, was a Griever.

203
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,158
Don't worry, you're safe here with us.

204
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,293
Nothing gets through those walls.

205
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,028
All right, guys.

206
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,231
Let's tuck it in for the night. Come on.

207
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,796
It was a good night.

208
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,271
Good job, man.

209
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,899
<i>You're safe here with us.</i>

210
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,237
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

211
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,333
<i>What's out there?</i>

212
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,072
<i>Thomas, Thomas.</i>

213
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,714
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

214
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,619
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

215
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,812
Thomas.

216
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,991
Follow me.

217
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,699
It's peaceful, isn't it?

218
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,306
I know it's hard to believe,
but it wasn't always this way.

219
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,907
We had dark days.

220
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,746
We lost a lot of boys to fear.

221
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,549
To panic.

222
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,885
We've come far since then.

223
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,947
Established order...

224
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,256
made peace.

225
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,461
Yeah. Why are you telling me this?

226
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,060
Because you're not like the others.

227
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,194
You're curious.

228
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,635
But you're one of us now.

229
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,901
You need to know what that means.

230
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,993
What happened to them?

231
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,300
Like I said...

232
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,563
dark days, Thomas.

233
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,018
Has anyone tried climbing to the top?

234
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,152
Tried it. The ivy doesn't go all the way
to the top.

235
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,052
Besides, where are you gonna go from there?

236
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,098
And what about the Box?
Next time it comes up...

237
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,690
No, we tried that.

238
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,927
The Box won't go back down
with someone in it.

239
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,471
- Okay, what if we...
- No, we tried it, all right?

240
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,767
Twice.

241
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:01,677
All right? Trust me.
Anything you think of, we've already tried.

242
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,775
The only way out of here
is through the maze.

243
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,542
Now, look, you wanna be helpful?

244
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,879
Here. Go dig us up
some more fertilizer.

245
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,056
"Just get the fertilizer, Thomas."

246
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,204
"Are you sure, guys?
I can't help in any other way?"

247
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,498
"No, just get the fertilizer.

248
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,369
"You know where it is.
It's just out in the middle of the woods."

249
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,514
You're Ben, right?

250
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,354
I don't know if we ever...

251
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,589
Are you okay?

252
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,523
Get the hell off me!

253
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,458
It's your fault.

254
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,035
I saw you.

255
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,535
You did this.

256
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,071
I saw you!

257
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,959
Hey! Hey!

258
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,295
Hey!

259
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,935
Help!

260
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,502
Help! Help!

261
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,203
Help!

262
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,382
I'll kill you!

263
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,291
Hold him down.

264
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,928
What are you doing?

265
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,524
Calm down, Ben.

266
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,859
What the hell happened?

267
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,093
- He just attacked me!
- Are you okay?

268
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,564
Calm down, Ben.

269
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,197
No. No.

270
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,499
Lift his shirt.

271
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,635
Lift his shirt.

272
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,700
No! No!

273
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,608
No! no!

274
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,011
Please. Please.

275
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,484
He's been stung.

276
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,349
In the middle of the day?

277
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,987
Help me, please.

278
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,956
Please. Please, just help.

279
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,619
Put him in the pit.

280
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,130
Everybody, help.
Take him to the pit.

281
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,187
No!

282
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,427
- Med-jack!
- Please don't do it!

283
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,262
Calm down, Ben.

284
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,633
Back down, Ben.

285
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,737
Listen to me! Please!

286
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,066
Please, stop, please!

287
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,543
He did this!

288
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,478
Please stop! No!
No, please! Help me!

289
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,345
<i>So what happened to him?</i>

290
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,882
It's called "The Changing."

291
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,027
lt's what happens
when someone gets stung.

292
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:40,989
Listen.

293
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,537
We haven't been able to get a clear word
out of Ben since it happened.

294
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,109
He's not making any sense.

295
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,368
And it's only gonna get worse.

296
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:00,506
The infection is spreading.
He's dangerous.

297
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,078
What did he say to you?

298
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,228
He said he saw me...

299
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,457
and that this was all my fault.

300
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,030
How could this be my fault?

301
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,744
Get some rest.

302
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,614
- Alby?
- Yeah.

303
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,813
What's gonna happen to him?

304
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,032
Just listen to me.
Just, please, listen to me!

305
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,727
Please, Minho!

306
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,032
Alby!

307
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,101
No, please. Please, don't.

308
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,761
Please, don't do it.

309
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,344
Poles!

310
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,928
Move in!

311
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,994
No, no, no! Please!

312
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,601
No, please!
Please, don't!

313
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,675
I can get better!
Please, just listen to me!

314
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,634
Please, stop, please!

315
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,870
- Push him in!
- Stop!

316
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,883
I'll get better!

317
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,418
He belongs to the maze now.

318
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,162
Do you think he might make it?

319
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,998
Ben?

320
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,335
No.

321
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,400
No one survives a night in the maze.

322
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,440
We just gotta forget about him.

323
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,710
<i>Thomas.</i>

324
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,772
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

325
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,045
<i>Don't make it easy on them.</i>

326
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,951
<i>Thomas.</i>

327
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,782
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

328
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,152
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

329
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,760
<i>This is gonna hurt a little.</i>

330
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,093
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

331
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,829
<i>Thomas, you have to choose.</i>

332
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,361
But why would Alby go into the maze?

333
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,862
I mean, he's not a runner.

334
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,628
Things are different now.

335
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,071
Alby went to retrace Ben's footsteps
before sundown.

336
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,267
Are you gonna help?

337
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,370
So he's gonna go back
to where Ben was just stung...

338
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,934
Alby knows what he's doing...

339
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,172
all right?

340
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,337
He knows better than any of us.

341
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,309
What does that mean?

342
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,284
It's like you have heard, yeah?

343
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,427
Every month,
the Box sends up a new arrival.

344
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,755
But someone had to be first, right?

345
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,431
Someone had to have spent
a whole month in the Glade, alone.

346
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,935
That was Alby.

347
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,599
I mean, it can't have been easy.

348
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,710
But when those other boys started
coming up, one after the other...

349
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,768
he saw the truth.

350
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,245
And he learned
that the most important thing...

351
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,306
is that we all have each other.

352
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,280
Because we're all in this together.

353
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,899
Yeah.

354
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,637
There you go, Greenie.

355
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,662
They should be back by now.

356
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,532
What happens if they don't make it?

357
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,601
They're gonna make it.

358
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,841
What happens if they don't?

359
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,408
They're gonna make it.

360
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,648
Come on, guys,
can't we send someone after them?

361
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,446
That's against the rules.

362
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,185
Either they make it back or they don't.

363
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,122
We can't risk losing anyone else.

364
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,502
Oh, no.

365
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,832
There!

366
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,506
Wait, somethings wrong.

367
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,111
Come on, Minho, you can do it!

368
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,242
Come on! Go!

369
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,182
Come on, you can make it!

370
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,914
Minho, you gotta leave him!

371
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,720
They're not gonna make it.

372
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,783
You gotta leave him!

373
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,208
Thomas, no!

374
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,489
Good job.

375
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,155
You just killed yourself.

376
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,129
What?

377
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,211
What happened to him?

378
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,445
What does it look like?

379
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,917
He got stung.

380
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,921
What happened to his head?

381
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,556
I did what I had to do.

382
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,673
Okay. Okay, help me get him up.

383
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,211
We gotta go.
The maze is already changing.

384
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,714
Hey, Minho!

385
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,712
We can't just leave him here.

386
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,932
We gotta get him up.

387
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,408
Come on.

388
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,148
Just sit him down.
Sit him down.

389
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,535
This isn't going to work. We gotta go.

390
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:56,831
We gotta go!

391
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,306
Wait, what are you talking about?
We gotta hide him.

392
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,603
- Where?
- I don't know.

393
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:04,203
Are you telling me there's not
a single place we could take him?

394
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,780
Listen to me, shuck-face, all right.

395
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,286
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to go!

396
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,249
You don't get it.

397
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,596
We're already dead.

398
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,679
Two, three...

399
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,348
Two, three...

400
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,390
Okay.

401
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,065
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

402
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,705
What are you doing?

403
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,642
We gotta go. We gotta go now!

404
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,579
No, no, just a little more
and we'll tie it off.

405
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,742
Minho, stay with me.

406
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,386
Stay with me, Minho.

407
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,047
Just a little more, we're almost there.

408
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,716
- L'm sorry, Greenie.
- What?

409
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,850
Minho!

410
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,331
Okay.

411
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,143
Come on.

412
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,740
Oh, shit!

413
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,545
You're a crazy son of a bitch.

414
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,914
Come on, follow me.
Come on!

415
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:18,392
Okay, it's changing.
Come on, come on!

416
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,761
This section is closing. Come on.

417
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,559
We can lose it down here!

418
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,294
Thomas!

419
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,964
What are you waiting for?
Get out of there!

420
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,006
Come on!

421
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,613
Come on!

422
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,756
Come on, Thomas!
Don't look back!

423
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,018
Run!

424
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,085
Move it, Thomas! Go on!

425
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,925
Move your ass!
Let's go! Come on!

426
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,995
Come on, Greenie! Let's go!

427
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,963
Thomas!

428
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,106
Guys, 98¢ "P!

429
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,289
I told you, Chuck.

430
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,486
They're not coming back.

431
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,831
Let's go.

432
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,542
No way.

433
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,000
Yeah!

434
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,835
Yes!

435
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,539
Yeah!

436
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,619
I got him, I got him, I got him.

437
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,553
Watch out. Easy.

438
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,619
- What happened out there?
- How did you guys make it out?

439
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,463
You saw a Griever?

440
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,598
Yeah, I saw one.

441
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,266
He didn't just see it.

442
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,406
He killed it.

443
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,009
Things are changing.

444
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,617
There's no denying that.

445
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:32,350
First, Ben gets stung in broad daylight.

446
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,621
And then Alby.

447
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,189
And now our Greenie, here,
has taken it upon himself...

448
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,960
to go into the maze.

449
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,401
Which is a clear violation
of our rules here.

450
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,463
Yeah...

451
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,441
but he saved Alby's life.

452
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,741
Did he?

453
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,783
For <i>3</i> years,
we have coexisted with these things.

454
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,114
And now, you've killed one of them.

455
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,057
Who knows what that could mean for us.

456
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,055
What do you suggest we do?

457
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,422
He has to be punished.

458
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,567
- Come on.
- He killed a Griever!

459
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,124
Minho.

460
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,105
You were there with him.
What do you think?

461
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,506
I think...

462
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,579
in all the time we've been here...

463
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,615
no one has ever killed a Griever before.

464
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,787
When I turned tail and ran...

465
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,256
this dumb shank stayed behind
to help Alby.

466
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,764
Look, I don't know
if he's brave or stupid.

467
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,466
But whatever it is,
we need more of it.

468
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,471
I say we make him a runner.

469
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,599
A runner? What?

470
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,075
Minho, let's not jump the gun, here.

471
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,012
Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!

472
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,144
If you want to throw the newbie a parade,
that's fine.

473
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,014
Go ahead.

474
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,918
But if there is one thing
I know about the maze...

475
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,616
it is that you do not...

476
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,897
Okay, wait. I know that sound.

477
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,705
- The Box. It's coming back up.
- It shouldn't be.

478
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,413
- Newt, what do you see?
- Do you see it?

479
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,552
It's a girl.

480
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,052
No way.

481
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,766
I think she's dead.

482
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,070
What's in her hand?

483
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:12,044
"She's the last one... ever."

484
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,624
What the hell does that mean?

485
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,053
Thomas...

486
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,214
Do you still think I'm overreacting?

487
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,564
Jeff, what's going on?

488
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,859
What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?

489
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,926
Hey man,
I got my job the same way you did.

490
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,735
Do you recognize her?

491
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,737
No.

492
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,980
Really? Because she seemed
to recognize you.

493
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:17,975
What about the note?

494
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,987
We'll worry about the note later.

495
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,523
I think you should worry about it now.

496
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,390
We've got enough to deal with
at the moment.

497
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,192
He's right, Newt.

498
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,795
If the Box isn't coming back up,
how long do you think we can last?

499
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,001
No one said that.

500
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,800
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

501
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,540
We'll just wait until she wakes up
and see what she knows.

502
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,144
Somebody has gotta have
some answers around here.

503
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,640
Okay.

504
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,816
- Where are you going?
- Back into the maze.

505
00:46:58,682 --> 00:46:59,683
Hey.

506
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,028
Hey, Thomas.

507
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:06,293
What is this with you? A death wish?

508
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,936
You just got out
and now you want back in?

509
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,900
Newt said that no one has ever seen a
Griever and lived to tell about it, right?

510
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,410
Minho, now we have one.

511
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,639
You're telling me
you're not even a little bit curious?

512
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,341
Not really, no.

513
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,555
So, what's the plan?

514
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,748
You're gonna go out
and dissect that thing all by yourself?

515
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,588
I will if l have to.

516
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,329
Have the other runners left yet?

517
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,557
The other runners quit this morning.

518
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:42,699
After Alby got stung, they're not
in any hurry to get back out there.

519
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,938
Why are you?

520
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,841
I think it's time we find out
what we're really up against.

521
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,714
All right.

522
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,183
But you're not going back out there alone.

523
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,518
Meet me in the woods in half-an-hour.

524
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,077
Will this be enough?

525
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,947
Okay.

526
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,909
Let's go.

527
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,432
Come on!

528
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,492
That's disgusting.

529
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,428
There's something in there.

530
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,362
You mean, besides a Griever pancake?

531
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,906
Whoa, what are you doing?

532
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,951
I thought you said it was dead.

533
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,798
- Was it a reflex?
- You hope.

534
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,368
Okay, come on.
Let's try and pull it out.

535
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,567
Everyone get a hand on it.
Come on.

536
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,436
All right, ready? On three.

537
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,339
One, two, three!

538
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,344
- Are you okay, Fry?
- Yeah. Thanks, brother.

539
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,215
What the hell is that?

540
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:59,592
Interesting.

541
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,135
Okay, whatever it is...

542
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,137
can we take this up back at the Glade?

543
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,935
Because I don't want to meet
this guy's friends.

544
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,474
He's right.

545
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,305
It's getting late.
Come on.

546
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,086
We found this.

547
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,821
It was inside a Griever.

548
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,620
These are the same letters
we get in our supplies.

549
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,754
Yeah.

550
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,198
Whoever put us here
obviously made the Grievers.

551
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,532
This is the first real clue, the first
anything, you've found in over <i>3</i> years.

552
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,095
- Right, Minho?
- Right.

553
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,203
Newt, we gotta go back out there.

554
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:44,072
Who knows where this might lead us.

555
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,846
You see what he's trying to do, right?

556
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,716
First he breaks our rules...

557
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,846
and then he tries to convince us
to abandon them totally.

558
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,390
The rules are the only thing
that have ever held us together.

559
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,858
Why now are we questioning that?

560
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,694
If Alby was here,
you know he'd agree with me.

561
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:04,925
This shank needs to be punished.

562
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,069
You're right.

563
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,872
Thomas broke the rules.

564
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,878
One night in the pit,
and no food.

565
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,642
Come on, Newt! One night in the pit?

566
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,216
Do you think that's gonna stop him
from going into the maze?

567
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,445
No.

568
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:29,114
And we can't just have non-runners running
into the maze whenever they feel like it.

569
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,717
So let's just make this official.

570
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,159
Starting from tomorrow,
you're a runner.

571
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,490
Wow.

572
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,565
- Gally...
- No, Fry.

573
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,607
Thanks, Newt.

574
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,855
Hey, where are we going?

575
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,958
You'll see.

576
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,958
It's the maze.

577
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,564
All of it.

578
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,163
What do you mean "all of it"?
I thought you were still mapping it.

579
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,870
There's nothing left to map.

580
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,170
I've run every inch of it myself.

581
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,713
Every cycle.

582
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,347
Every pattern.

583
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:05,543
If there was a way out,
we would have found it by now.

584
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,721
Why haven't you told anyone this?

585
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,888
It was Alby's call.

586
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,190
People needed to believe
we had a chance of getting out.

587
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,032
But maybe now...

588
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,928
we have a real chance.

589
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:29,666
Take a look at this.

590
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,513
About a year ago, we started exploring
these outer sections.

591
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,551
We found these numbers
printed on the walls.

592
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,243
Sections 1 through 8.

593
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:43,218
See, the way it works,
is every night, when the maze changes...

594
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,257
it opens up a new section.

595
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,861
So today, Section 6 was open.

596
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:51,693
Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.

597
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,199
The pattern always stays the same.

598
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,403
What's so special about 7?

599
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,041
I don't know.

600
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,705
But last night,
when you killed that Griever...

601
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,611
Section 7 was open.

602
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,273
I think it must be where it comes from.

603
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:12,249
Tomorrow, you and I
are gonna take a closer look.

604
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,577
Hey!

605
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,751
What are you guys doing?
You're not allowed in here.

606
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,386
- Sorry, it's just the...
- lt's the girl.

607
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,990
Is she awake?

608
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:22,818
You could say that.

609
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,162
Chuck, what's going on?

610
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,325
Girls are awesome.

611
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,365
Leave me alone!

612
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:30,903
Watch your head!

613
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,804
Hey, throw one more of those things...

614
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,802
- Go away!
- We come in peace!

615
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:36,985
- What happened?
- Just duck!

616
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,535
I don't think she likes us very much.

617
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,521
- What do you want from me?
- We just wanna talk.

618
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:41,811
L'm warning you!

619
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,782
Take cover, y'all!
Take cover!

620
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,881
Hey, it's Thomas!
It's Thomas!

621
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,688
L'm gonna come up, okay?

622
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,423
Okay.

623
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,037
Just me.

624
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,607
L'm coming up.

625
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,679
Okay, just...

626
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,118
Easy, all right?

627
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,388
Where am I?

628
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,387
What is this place?

629
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,025
Why can't I remember anything?

630
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:28,062
This is all normal. Okay?
We've all been through this.

631
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,119
Okay?

632
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,326
Your name will come back to you
in a couple of days.

633
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,562
- It's the one thing that...
- Teresa.

634
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:36,863
What did you say?

635
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,098
My name.

636
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,771
It's Teresa.

637
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,173
Teresa, I'm Thomas.

638
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:50,143
But you already knew that,
though, I guess, huh?

639
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,288
They said I kept saying
your name in my sleep.

640
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:55,616
Who are you?

641
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,489
I don't know.

642
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,031
I can't remember.

643
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:09,193
None of us here can remember anything.

644
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,736
We all woke up here
just like you did.

645
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,432
Hey, I promise...

646
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,372
I'm gonna take this.

647
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,479
Okay.

648
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,616
What's going on up there?

649
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,820
Is she coming down?

650
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,229
Listen, you guys just give
us a second, okay?

651
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,567
All right.

652
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,232
Come on.

653
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,804
Is this what all girls are like?

654
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:55,910
That girl is crazy.

655
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,550
"She's the last one."
What does that mean?

656
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,359
L'm not sure.

657
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,055
Ever since you came up,
that Box hasn't gone back down.

658
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:14,330
I just think it's got everyone
a little worried.

659
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,066
Especially Gally.

660
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,544
He thinks it's my fault.

661
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,811
Are you sure you don't
remember anything else?

662
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,021
I remember water...

663
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,921
feeling like I was drowning.

664
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,884
These faces staring at me.

665
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,400
And this woman's voice
saying the same thing over and over.

666
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:48,934
"Wicked is good."

667
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,839
Ever since I've been here,
I've had these dreams.

668
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,037
I thought they were dreams.

669
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:02,105
You...

670
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,250
You were there.

671
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:08,946
You were there...

672
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,993
and you told me that
everything was gonna change.

673
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,959
What does it mean?

674
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,131
I don't know.
I just always get pieces.

675
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,504
And the others don't remember anything?

676
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:26,630
No.

677
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,304
Why are we different?

678
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,420
These were in my pocket when I came up.

679
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,562
"W.C.K.D."

680
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,628
"Wicked is good."

681
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,873
What if we were sent here for a reason?

682
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,070
Alby.

683
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,273
We don't even know what this stuff is.

684
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:09,908
We don't know who sent it.

685
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,748
Or why it came up here with you.

686
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,789
For all we know,
this thing could kill him.

687
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,446
He's already dying.

688
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,519
Look at him.

689
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,359
How could this possibly make it any worse?

690
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,827
Come on, it's worth a try.

691
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:30,668
All right.

692
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,667
Do it.

693
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,142
Okay.

694
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,310
You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!

695
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:48,412
No!

696
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,321
Watch out!

697
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,725
Get the syringe! Let go!

698
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,204
Well, that worked.

699
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,074
Okay, from now on...

700
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:11,237
someone stays here and
watches him around the clock.

701
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:17,046
Hey.

702
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,820
Sundown, Greenie. Time to go.

703
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,868
Hey, what is your problem with me?

704
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,671
Everything started going wrong
the minute you showed up.

705
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,240
First Ben, then Alby...

706
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,380
and now the girl.

707
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,179
Everybody saw she recognized you.

708
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,617
And I'm betting you know who she is.

709
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,067
Gally...

710
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:19,738
you know we can't stay here forever, right?

711
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,428
Who's there?

712
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,765
It's just me.

713
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:45,633
Sorry, Chuck.

714
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,103
Here.

715
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,436
You'll run better on a full stomach.

716
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,485
Thanks, Chuck.

717
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,427
Hey, what do you got there?

718
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,998
Wow, that came out pretty damn good.

719
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,705
What's that for?

720
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,975
It's for my parents.

721
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,739
You remember your parents?

722
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:28,980
No.

723
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,974
I mean, I know I must have them.

724
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,547
And wherever they are,
I'm sure they miss me...

725
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:39,559
but I can't miss them
because I don't remember them.

726
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,397
What do you think
you're gonna find out there tomorrow?

727
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,238
I don't know.

728
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:58,235
But if there's a way out, Chuck,
me and Minho are gonna find it.

729
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,545
Here.

730
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,790
Chuck, why would you give this to me?

731
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,929
I can't remember them anyway.

732
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:23,293
But maybe if you find a way out,
you can give it to them for me.

733
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,571
I'll let you get some sleep.

734
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,313
Hey, Chuck.

735
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:40,212
Come here.

736
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,150
Put out your hand.

737
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,731
I want you to give that to them yourself.

738
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,193
We're gonna get out of here.

739
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,463
All of us.

740
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,796
Okay?

741
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,940
I promise.

742
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,776
- Yeah.
- All right.

743
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,506
- Good night.
- Good night, buddy.

744
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:26,523
Big day, Greenie. Are you sure
you don't wanna sit this one out?

745
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,597
Come on, man. Get me out of here.

746
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:29,762
All right.

747
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,079
Let's go!

748
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,961
This way. Not much
further to the inner ring.

749
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,333
Let's go!

750
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,007
Come on! This way.

751
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,698
That's strange.

752
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:37,931
What?

753
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,838
Seven is not supposed to be open
for another week.

754
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,345
What the hell is this place?

755
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,144
We call them blades.

756
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,140
It's Ben's, isn't it?

757
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,706
Yeah.

758
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:18,311
A Griever must have pulled him down here.

759
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:26,450
Whoa, hey!

760
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,534
I think it's showing us the way.

761
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:58,208
Wait, wait, wait.

762
01:07:58,274 --> 01:07:59,548
What, what?

763
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,688
This way. Come on.

764
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:30,012
Minho, you ever see this place before?

765
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:32,817
No.

766
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,342
It's just another dead end.

767
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,566
Are you sure about this?

768
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,270
Nope.

769
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,735
Grievers.

770
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,418
What the hell was that?

771
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,861
We gotta get out of here.

772
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:29,061
Give me the key, give me the key!

773
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:35,702
Move, move!

774
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,111
We gotta go!
Run, Thomas!

775
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,980
We're gonna get trapped!

776
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,281
Go! Go!

777
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:52,919
Go, go, go!

778
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,083
Move!

779
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,127
Minho!

780
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,103
Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

781
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:12,871
Come on, move!

782
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,937
Keep going!
Keep going! Let's go!

783
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,316
Go, go, go!

784
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:34,794
Go, go, go!

785
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,304
Come on!
Don't look back!

786
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,478
Come on!

787
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,679
Oh, shit!

788
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:57,349
There!

789
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,546
What the hell's going on out there?

790
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:21,001
What the hell you done now, Thomas?

791
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,882
We found something, a new passage.
We think it could be a way out.

792
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,680
- Really?
- lt's true.

793
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,378
We opened a door,
something I'd never seen before.

794
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,185
I think it must be where the
Grievers go during the day.

795
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,417
Wait!

796
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,856
You're saying you found
the Grievers' home?

797
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,156
And you want us to go in?

798
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:36,857
Their way in could be our way out, Chuck.

799
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,365
Yeah, or there could be a dozen Grievers
on the other side.

800
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,732
The truth is, Thomas doesn't know
what he has done, as usual.

801
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,829
Yeah, at least I did something, Gally.
I mean, what have you done?

802
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,999
Aside from hide behind these walls
all the time?

803
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,474
Let me tell you something, Greenie.

804
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,239
You've been here <i>3</i> days, all right?
I've been here <i>3</i> years!

805
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,577
Yeah, you've been here <i>3</i> years
and you're still here, Gally!

806
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:55,808
What does that tell you?

807
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,407
Maybe you should start doing things
a little differently.

808
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,680
Maybe you should be in charge,
what about that?

809
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,585
Hey, it's Alby!

810
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04,113
He's awake.

811
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,521
Has he said anything?

812
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:07,754
No.

813
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,921
Alb?"

814
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,165
Alby, are you all right?

815
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,537
Hey, Alby.

816
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:30,183
Alby, we might have just
found a way out of the maze.

817
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:33,886
Do you hear me?
We could be getting out of here.

818
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,857
We can't.

819
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,251
We can't leave.

820
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,453
They won't let us.

821
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,429
What are you talking about?

822
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:48,295
I remember.

823
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:54,399
What do you remember?

824
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,577
You.

825
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,315
You were always their favorite, Thomas.

826
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:06,115
Always.

827
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,714
Why did you do this?

828
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:15,092
Why did you come here?

829
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:26,762
Winston, what's going on?

830
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:29,036
It's the doors. They aren't closing.

831
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:25,990
Chuck, go to the Council Hall
and start barricading the doors.

832
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:27,189
Winston, you go with him.

833
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,030
Got it.

834
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:28,966
Get the others.

835
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,867
Tell them to go to the forest.
Go hide, now!

836
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:32,997
Minho, I want you to grab
every weapon you can find.

837
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:34,062
I'll meet you at Council Hall.

838
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,335
Let's go.

839
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:40,011
Teresa, you and I are gonna go
get Alby, all right? Come on.

840
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,346
All right, everybody hide!

841
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:50,812
Teresa!

842
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:53,883
Come on! Run! Run!

843
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,495
Stay down!

844
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,663
Run!

845
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:20,412
Zart!

846
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,213
(He") me!

847
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,123
Go! Get to the village!

848
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,592
Go, go, go!

849
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,735
Stay down, stay down!

850
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,703
Gally! Let me in, let me in!

851
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:54,282
Alby!

852
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:55,344
Are you okay?

853
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,787
What's going on?

854
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:57,846
They're here.

855
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,051
Grievers?

856
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,056
Thomas, what do we do?

857
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,567
It's got me!

858
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,707
Everybody, run, run, run!

859
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,505
Jeff, come on, go, go, go!

860
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,754
Everyone, go, go, go!

861
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:54,145
Keep moving! Oh, shit!

862
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,915
Alby!

863
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:58,579
Get behind me!

864
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:03,347
Come on!

865
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:07,792
Over here, let's go!

866
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,455
Over here!
Let's go! Come on!

867
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,062
Over here, come on!

868
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,499
Winston!

869
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:17,034
Get Alby inside.

870
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,534
Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!

871
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,206
Lock down the doors!

872
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:40,348
Careful.

873
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,062
Stay back, guys.

874
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:12,917
Is everyone all right?

875
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,223
Help!

876
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,158
.Hey, grab him'
- Help! '

877
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:21,361
Watch out!

878
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:29,099
Chuck!

879
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:33,337
- Chuck, no!
- Grab him!

880
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:34,776
Pull him back!

881
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,678
- Help!
- Chuck, don't let go!

882
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,343
No shit!

883
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:41,383
- Pull!
- Don't let him go!

884
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,873
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

885
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:07,941
Thanks, Alby.

886
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,648
Alby! Watch out!

887
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:13,943
Grab him!

888
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:19,683
Thomas, get them out.

889
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,018
Alby!

890
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:24,688
No!

891
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:25,788
Thomas...

892
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,527
- Thomas!
- Don't go out there!

893
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:28,823
No, Thomas, wait!

894
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,435
Thomas, wait!

895
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,270
Where is everybody?

896
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:42,142
Who's that over there?

897
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:50,145
Gally...

898
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,754
This is all you, Thomas!

899
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:54,725
Look around!

900
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,490
Back off, Gally!
It's not Thomas' fault!

901
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:57,586
You heard what Alby said!

902
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:58,932
- He's one of them!
- One of who?

903
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:03,197
He's one of them, and they sent him here
to destroy everything, and now he has!

904
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:05,761
Look around, Thomas! Look around!

905
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:07,031
This is your fault!

906
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:08,836
Back off, Gally!
This is not Thomas' fault!

907
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:11,639
What are you talking about?
Calm down.

908
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,879
They sent him here, and now he's destroyed
everything that we've built!

909
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,746
What are you talking about?

910
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,079
Maybe he's right.

911
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,018
Thomas...

912
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,523
I need to remember, Teresa.

913
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,418
Thomas...

914
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:29,518
Thomas!

915
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:30,654
No, don't!

916
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:33,324
Thomas!

917
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:35,399
Chuck, get the other syringe!

918
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,462
It's okay.

919
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,333
Thomas, I'm here.

920
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:52,049
<i>Who put us here?</i>

921
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,787
<i>That we don't know.</i>

922
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,020
<i>Teresa...</i>

923
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:02,889
<i>why are we doing this?</i>

924
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,064
<i>Excellent, Thomas.</i>

925
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,363
Come with me.

926
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:11,727
Wicked isn't good.

927
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:12,828
<i>Thomas...</i>

928
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,406
Wicked is good.

929
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:16,777
<i>How could this be my fault?</i>

930
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:18,004
<i>You did this!</i>

931
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,808
<i>I saw you!</i>

932
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:23,980
<i>I can't keep watching them die.</i>

933
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:31,490
Hey.

934
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,520
Are you okay?

935
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:38,955
What the hell were you thinking?

936
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,600
What happened?

937
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:47,934
Gally has taken control.

938
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:51,744
He said we had a choice.
Either join him...

939
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,574
or get banished at sundown with you.

940
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,173
And the others agreed to that?

941
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:03,245
Gally has everyone convinced that
you're the reason all this has happened.

942
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,224
Well, he's been right so far.

943
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:11,593
What are you talking about?

944
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:14,062
This place...

945
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:17,233
it's not what we thought it was.

946
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:21,239
It's not a prison, it's a test.

947
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:24,168
It all started when we were kids.

948
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:27,943
They would give us these challenges.

949
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:31,107
They were experimenting on us.

950
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:35,279
And then people started disappearing.

951
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:38,253
Every month,
one after the other, like clockwork.

952
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,992
They were sending them up into the maze.

953
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:43,323
Yeah, but not all of us.

954
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:45,659
What do you mean?

955
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,563
Guys, I'm one of them.

956
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:55,836
The people who put you here,
I worked with them.

957
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,174
I watched you guys for years.

958
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,410
The entire time you have been here...

959
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:05,608
I was on the other side of it.

960
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,753
So were you.

961
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:12,818
What?

962
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,793
Teresa, we did this to them.

963
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:19,993
No.

964
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,791
That can't be true.

965
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:26,369
It is. I saw it.

966
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,804
Why would they send us up
if we were with them?

967
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:32,469
It doesn't matter.

968
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,280
He's right.

969
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,645
It doesn't matter.

970
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,116
Any of it.

971
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:47,282
Because the people we were before the maze
don't even exist anymore.

972
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,520
These Creators took care of that.

973
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:54,359
But what does matter is who we are now,
and what we do...

974
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:56,195
right now.

975
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,933
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

976
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:03,335
Yeah, but if l hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

977
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,213
Maybe.

978
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:16,721
But I know that if he were here, he would
be telling you the exact same thing.

979
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:21,089
Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.

980
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:24,662
Because if we do nothing...

981
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,098
then that means Alby died for nothing,
and I can't have that.

982
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:33,895
Okay.

983
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:39,166
Okay, but we gotta get through Gally first.

984
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:09,975
This is such a waste.

985
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:16,943
Gally...

986
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:23,722
It doesn't feel right, man.

987
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:27,325
Yeah, what if Thomas is right?

988
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:30,254
Maybe he can lead us home.

989
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,455
We are home.

990
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:36,727
Okay?

991
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:41,064
I don't wanna have to cross
any more names off that wall.

992
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:44,804
You really think banishing us
is gonna solve anything?

993
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:46,910
No.

994
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:50,071
But this isn't a banishing.

995
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,177
It's an offering.

996
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,211
What? Wait!
Gally, what are you doing?

997
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,723
You really think I'm gonna let Thomas
back into the maze after what he has done?

998
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:03,489
Look around you!

999
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:06,197
Look at our Glade!

1000
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:10,435
This is the only way.

1001
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,903
And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...

1002
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,702
everything goes back to the way it was.

1003
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:18,107
Are you listening to this?

1004
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,646
Why are you all just standing there?
He's crazy!

1005
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:21,612
You shut up.

1006
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,377
If you stay here,
the Grievers are going to come back.

1007
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:26,214
They're gonna come back,
and they're gonna keep coming back...

1008
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,582
until you're all dead!

1009
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:29,451
Shut up! Tie him up!

1010
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:33,251
Do you hear me? I said tie him up!

1011
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,083
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

1012
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:03,179
You don't have to come with us,
but we are leaving.

1013
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:05,722
Anyone else who wants to come,
now is your last chance.

1014
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,418
Don't listen to him,
he's just trying to scare you.

1015
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:10,258
No, I'm not trying to scare you.
You're already scared.

1016
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:12,025
L'm scared.

1017
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:18,695
But I'd rather risk my life out there
than spending the rest of it in here.

1018
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,063
We don't belong here.

1019
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:25,406
This place isn't our home.

1020
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,008
We were put here.

1021
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,973
We were trapped here.

1022
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:33,982
At least, out there we have a choice.

1023
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,249
We can make it out of here.

1024
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,652
I know that.

1025
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:55,431
L'm sorry.

1026
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:11,589
Gally, it's over.

1027
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:16,718
Just come with us.

1028
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,701
Good luck against the Grievers.

1029
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:46,983
Everybody, this way!

1030
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,338
Keep it up, guys, we're almost there!

1031
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:18,722
Is it a Griever?

1032
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:20,019
Yeah.

1033
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:22,256
Shit.

1034
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:25,186
You take this, Chuck.
Stay behind us.

1035
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,861
It's okay. Just stick with me.

1036
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,929
Once we're through,
it will activate and the door will open.

1037
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,168
We stay close, we stick together...

1038
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,540
we get through this. We get out now...

1039
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,770
or we die trying.

1040
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,873
Ready?

1041
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:46,342
All right. Let's go!

1042
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,325
Get up, look out!

1043
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,462
Push it!

1044
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:13,835
Look out!

1045
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:24,116
The key!

1046
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:25,247
Chuck!

1047
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,621
Watch the edge!

1048
01:31:33,387 --> 01:31:34,388
Oh, no.

1049
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,801
- I got you, Chuck!
- Pull me up!

1050
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,641
Come on!

1051
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,582
Thomas! Thomas!

1052
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:54,242
Chuck?

1053
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:55,787
We got more coming!

1054
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:59,247
Keep it steady, guys!

1055
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:02,552
It works!

1056
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:05,762
Teresa, go!

1057
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,162
Don't back down! Keep pushing!

1058
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:12,499
Stay together!

1059
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,071
There's gotta be a way out! Come on!

1060
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:27,208
Watch it!

1061
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:34,450
It won't open!

1062
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:38,687
Thomas!

1063
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:40,061
There's a code!

1064
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,495
Eight numbers!

1065
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:45,135
Eight sections of the maze.

1066
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:47,172
Hey, Minho! What's the sequence?

1067
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:48,229
What?

1068
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:50,936
The sections of the maze,
what's the sequence?

1069
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,935
Seven! One!

1070
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:55,104
Five! Two!

1071
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:56,304
Six! Four!

1072
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:57,405
Heads up!

1073
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:00,912
Minho!

1074
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,179
Minho!

1075
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:06,186
Get off of me!

1076
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:16,763
Jeff!

1077
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:21,029
What's the sequence? Come on!

1078
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:22,096
Six!

1079
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:23,642
Four! Eight!

1080
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,300
Three! You got it?

1081
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:28,479
Keep holding!

1082
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:30,908
Almost there, come on!

1083
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:32,349
The door opened!

1084
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,471
Seriously?

1085
01:35:44,205 --> 01:35:45,684
What happened here?

1086
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:21,516
So they were watching us.

1087
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:24,348
This whole time.

1088
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,549
<i>Hello.</i>

1089
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:53,878
<i>My name is Doctor Ava Paige.</i>

1090
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:59,257
<i>I'm Director of Operations of the
World Catastrophe Killzone Department.</i>

1091
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:03,919
<i>If you're watching this, that means you have
successfully completed the Maze Trials.</i>

1092
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:07,491
<i>I wish I could be there in person
to cangratulate you...</i>

1093
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:13,070
<i>but circumstances seem
to have prevented it.</i>

1094
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:16,037
<i>I'm sure by now,
you must all be very confused...</i>

1095
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:17,599
<i>(a!!!)ff...</i>

1096
01:37:17,765 --> 01:37:19,267
<i>frightened.</i>

1097
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:22,971
<i>I can only assure you,
that everything that's happened to you...</i>

1098
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:26,017
<i>everything we've done to you...</i>

1099
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:28,210
<i>it was all done for a reason.</i>

1100
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:30,616
<i>You won't remember...</i>

1101
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:33,520
<i>but the Sun has scorched our world.</i>

1102
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,852
<i>Billions of lives lost to fire...</i>

1103
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:39,720
<i>famine...</i>

1104
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:43,201
<i>suffering on a global scale.</i>

1105
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:46,361
<i>The fallout was unimaginable.</i>

1106
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:49,733
<i>What came after was worse.</i>

1107
01:37:50,564 --> 01:37:52,202
<i>We called it the Flare.</i>

1108
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:56,681
<i>A deadly virus that attacks the brain.</i>

1109
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:58,680
<i>It is violent...</i>

1110
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:00,375
<i>unpredictable...</i>

1111
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,119
<i>incurable.</i>

1112
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:05,948
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

1113
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:11,859
<i>In time, a new generation emerged
that could survive the virus.</i>

1114
01:38:12,019 --> 01:38:15,523
<i>Suddenly, there was a reason
to hope for a cure.</i>

1115
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,462
<i>But finding it would not be easy.</i>

1116
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:22,733
<i>The young would have to be tested,
even sacrificed...</i>

1117
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:25,236
<i>inside harsh environments...</i>

1118
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:27,936
<i>where their brain activity
could be studied.</i>

1119
01:38:28,369 --> 01:38:30,007
<i>All in an effort to understand...</i>

1120
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:32,243
<i>what makes them different...</i>

1121
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,284
<i>what makes you different.</i>

1122
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:39,546
<i>You may not realize it...</i>

1123
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:42,091
<i>but you're very important.</i>

1124
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:45,327
<i>Unfortunately, your trials
have only just begun.</i>

1125
01:38:45,486 --> 01:38:49,662
<i>As you will no doubt soon discover,
not everyone agrees with our methods.</i>

1126
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:52,997
<i>Progress is slow, people are scared.</i>

1127
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,731
<i>It may be too late for us...</i>

1128
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:57,672
<i>for me...</i>

1129
01:38:57,831 --> 01:38:59,208
<i>but not for you.</i>

1130
01:39:00,067 --> 01:39:01,910
<i>The outside world awaits.</i>

1131
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:03,914
<i>Remember...</i>

1132
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:08,787
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

1133
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:46,047
Is it over?

1134
01:39:47,848 --> 01:39:49,828
She said we were important.

1135
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:53,554
What are we supposed to do now?

1136
01:40:02,129 --> 01:40:03,699
I don't know.

1137
01:40:09,136 --> 01:40:10,877
Let's get out of here.

1138
01:40:13,874 --> 01:40:14,909
No.

1139
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:20,883
- Gally?
- Don't.

1140
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,825
He's been stung.

1141
01:40:31,425 --> 01:40:32,768
We can't leave.

1142
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,768
We did. Gally, we're out.

1143
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,175
We're free.

1144
01:40:43,504 --> 01:40:44,676
Free?

1145
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:50,177
You think we're free out there?

1146
01:40:51,745 --> 01:40:52,780
No.

1147
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:57,058
No, there's no escape from this place.

1148
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:03,701
Gally, listen to me.

1149
01:41:03,857 --> 01:41:06,098
You're not thinking straight.

1150
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:07,899
You're not.

1151
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:10,776
Now, we can help you.

1152
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:14,301
Just put down the gun.

1153
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,810
I belong to the maze.

1154
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:18,711
Just put down the gun.

1155
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,153
We all do.

1156
01:41:43,964 --> 01:41:45,272
Thomas...

1157
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,578
Chuck.

1158
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,083
Oh, shit. Shit.

1159
01:41:56,143 --> 01:41:57,781
Look at me, look at me!

1160
01:41:58,846 --> 01:41:59,916
Oh, shit!

1161
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:01,721
Chuck, look at me, all right?

1162
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:03,693
I got you, buddy. Just hang on.

1163
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:05,195
It's okay.

1164
01:42:05,519 --> 01:42:07,021
Thomas, Thomas...

1165
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:14,564
No, Chuck.
You're gonna give it to them yourself.

1166
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:15,698
Remember, I told you that.

1167
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:17,036
Take it.

1168
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:18,802
No.

1169
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:22,439
Thank you.

1170
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,546
Thank you.

1171
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:29,752
No, Chuck, you're gonna get...

1172
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:34,681
Chuck.

1173
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:39,021
Chuck? Hey.

1174
01:42:40,954 --> 01:42:42,695
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1175
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:45,261
Come on, wake up!

1176
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,301
Damn it!

1177
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,950
We made it. Come on.

1178
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:05,584
L'm sorry!

1179
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,188
God damn it!

1180
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:11,559
Damn it!

1181
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:18,966
- Thomas.
- Chuck!

1182
01:43:22,462 --> 01:43:24,669
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

1183
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:38,881
Chuck!

1184
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,482
You can't just leave him there!

1185
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:21,733
You guys all right?

1186
01:44:22,222 --> 01:44:23,360
Don't worry.

1187
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:24,900
You're safe now.

1188
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:03,065
Relax, kid.

1189
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:06,775
Everything is gonna change.

1190
01:45:21,615 --> 01:45:25,188
I think it's safe to say
the Maze Trials were a complete success.

1191
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:29,157
<i>I wasn't expecting so
many survivors, but...</i>

1192
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:31,826
<i>the more the merrier.</i>

1193
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:39,405
<i>Thomas continues to surprise and impress.</i>

1194
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:44,477
<i>And for now,
they seem to have taken the bait.</i>

1195
01:45:45,605 --> 01:45:47,516
<i>It's too soon to say...</i>

1196
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:51,654
<i>but they could be the key to everything.</i>

1197
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:55,851
<i>So let's move forward.</i>

1198
01:45:57,317 --> 01:46:00,423
It's time now to begin Phase Two.

1198
01:46:01,305 --> 01:46:07,748
