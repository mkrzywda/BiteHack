-Got a showing at noon today.
-Yeah.

31
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:01,295
Did you ever get hold of her?

32
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:02,996
-Morning.
-Hey, kiddo.

33
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:05,295
Why did I get a license
if I can't get a car?

34
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,996
School starts
next week, right?

35
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,962
Syracuse application.
Early admission's due.

36
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:13,162
I spoke to Chris Simpson
about a referral.

37
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,094
Most of my friends
are going to State.

38
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:22,295
What? Danny, you worked
your butt off for this.

39
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:24,061
This is your next assignment.

40
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,761
Okay, what chapter are you on?

41
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:29,695
Halfway through five.

42
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,162
The part where they almost
kill that kid.

43
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,428
You know that I can
get through on my own now.

44
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:37,062
We made it this far, kid.

45
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:38,928
You wanna write
the book report, too?

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,295
Couple thinks 350

47
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,128
buys the keys
to their dream home.

48
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,262
-Yeah.
-"Can you show it to us at midnight?"

49
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,494
-Midnight?
-Midnight.

50
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:51,862
And the school
we saw yesterday, yes,

51
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:53,794
it was private,
but it's worth it.

52
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:58,761
Have you seen
these estimates for tuition?

53
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:01,162
And that doesn't
include room and board.

54
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:02,195
What?

55
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:07,293
We'll find a way.
We always do.

56
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,361
-It's got to be.
-Okay.

57
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:15,660
-Wednesday?
-Wednesday.

58
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,328
Unless it's written on a piece
of paper that she can hand...

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,893
-I listen. I listen.
-You don't! You don't! You...

60
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,128
I will not forget
the look on your...

61
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,228
I'll try.

62
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:30,027
-I love you.
-I sort of like you.

63
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,060
-Hey.
-Hey.

64
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:54,194
<i>Please watch the gap
between the train...</i>

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,526
<i>Now leaving Tarrytown.</i>

66
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:08,259
18 grand a year?

67
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:11,394
Sweetheart, it ain't MIT.
It's preschool.

68
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,926
<i>-What now?
-Wuthering Heights.</i>

69
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,992
-Charlotte Bronte.
-Emily.

70
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:19,494
-Emily.
-Yeah.

71
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,727
I would not forget that face.

72
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,459
I think
we locked eyes one time.

73
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:26,093
It was like, boom, you know?

74
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:34,227
You know,
my son's on me to retire.

75
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,826
I don't know. Maybe.
Every day's a grind.

76
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:39,925
Begins to feel
like a countdown.

77
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,826
This way in the morning,
that way at night.

78
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,760
And then one day
it's done with you.

79
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,793
-What's that?
-Life.

80
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,193
All right, see you
on the next go-round.

81
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,094
Take it easy.

82
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:25,992
My father died when he was 43.

83
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,358
Left me, my mom, my brothers
with mountains of debt.

84
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,059
Thank you.

85
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,292
I moved here from Ireland
with nothing.

86
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:36,325
Made a life for myself,
my family.

87
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:39,058
That's the reason
I do what I do.

88
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:42,291
To protect
young families like yours.

89
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:43,959
I will tell you this.

90
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:45,392
My wife Karen and I,

91
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:47,924
we worked hard,
did everything right.

92
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:49,924
401k, investments,

93
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:52,225
my son's education fund.

94
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:53,824
In 2008,

95
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:58,024
we lost it all.
Second mortgage was due.

96
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:02,159
We liquidated our assets,
cut every piece of fat

97
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,958
while the banks
on Wall Street got rich.

98
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:10,290
The one thing we didn't cut
was our life insurance policy.

99
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:13,991
With the higher rate.
But I know you too well.

100
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,125
Twenty may not even cut it.

101
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:19,958
Hey, Jeanie, would you pull
Jared Carlson's LTC policy?

102
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:21,191
Sure.

103
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:23,390
I'll look over it and give you
a call later today, okay?

104
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:24,858
Alex Murphy called,

105
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,324
confirmed drinks
at Paddy O'Brien's on 44th.

106
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,224
Thank you.

107
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:34,225
You can always reach out
to Webber and Finch.

108
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:35,291
Yes...

109
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:36,990
Hey, Mike.
Can I talk to you a sec?

110
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:38,857
-Sure, yeah.
-My office.

111
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:40,058
John, listen,
I'm gonna have...

112
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,225
Ten years. Just like that.

113
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,324
Your severance package.

114
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:51,225
Corporate is switching
from a financial buyout

115
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:53,291
to a medical extension.

116
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:55,823
You're giving me
insurance, Frank?

117
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:57,257
Medical's covered
for your family.

118
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,957
Unemployment should subsidize.

119
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:01,490
Karen and me,
we're hand to mouth.

120
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,356
You call HR anytime.

121
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:05,590
They'll answer
any questions you have.

122
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:10,158
I've got two mortgages,
a son who's going to college.

123
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,424
I'm five years
from retirement.

124
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:17,090
I'm 60 years of age, Frank.

125
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:18,958
It isn't personal, Mike.

126
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,524
Your salary, benefit package,

127
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:22,490
it's too much
against your return.

128
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:24,324
You work hard,
you play by the rules,

129
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,758
you're a good soldier,
and you don't deserve it.

130
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,923
But the reality is sometimes
soldiers end up casualties.

131
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,989
Hey.

132
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:20,422
<i>Hi, honey.
How's your day going?</i>

133
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,989
Good. What's going on,
sweetheart?

134
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:25,021
<i>I didn't wanna bother you,</i>

135
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,789
<i>but did you happen
to go by the bank today?</i>

136
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:31,356
No. I thought
we were gonna wait.

137
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,256
<i>Yeah, until this week.
We talked about this.</i>

138
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,888
<i>Danny has to register
for classes.</i>

139
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:37,790
<i>If we don't get an extension</i>

140
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,988
<i>on the mortgage,
neither check clears.</i>

141
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,322
<i>I mailed the tuition check
this morning.</i>

142
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,889
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

143
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:47,389
Yeah, yeah. Just in the middle
of it, you know.

144
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:48,455
Same old, same old.

145
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,922
<i>Okay, honey.
I'll see you tonight.</i>

146
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,423
Yep. Bye.

147
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:57,288
-Sorry I'm late.
-Hey, hey. There he is.

148
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,422
How you doing?
How long you been at it?

149
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,789
Only since security
escorted me from my building.

150
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:03,955
Cheers.

151
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:05,122
No.

152
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:09,022
Hey, two more for him.

153
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,223
So how did Karen take it?

154
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,156
You haven't told her?

155
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,422
What am I supposed to say?

156
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:19,755
I don't know, man.

157
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,955
That some asshole suit
just fired me.

158
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:24,455
She doesn't know
how bad it is.

159
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,989
We've got nothing

Ten years.

161
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,488
You build a home,
a life, a career.

162
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:32,921
And then one day
they sit you down.

-Yeah, yeah.

You gave up the job for them.
Don't forget that.

169

Those seven years
we were partners,

170
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,322
you always had my back.

171
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,188
So let someone else
have yours for once.

172
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,055
All right.

173
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,288
Well, you could have
ended up like me.

It ain't just cops being cops
anymore, you know?

-No, Captain Hawthorne.

The regular commuters,
I guess. Faces mostly.

318
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:38,347
-I'm sorry. Have we met?
-No. I'm Joanna.

319
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,181
-Michael.
-Michael.

320
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,748
How long is it between stops?
Four minutes?

321
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:48,914
Yeah, give or take.

322
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:52,113
Four minutes.
On and off, on and off.

323
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:54,313
It's so miscellaneous.

324
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:57,447
-I'm bothering you, aren't I?
-No.

325
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,448
I am.
You just wanna read your book.

326
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:06,113
It's... I'm married.

327
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:07,747
I... Me, too.

328
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,780
-Sorry.
-I study human behavior.

329
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:13,414
-It's an occupational hazard.
-Being married?

330
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:15,913
No, bothering people.

331
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,946
I'm a conversationalist.

332
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:23,113
So, in your job, you sit down,

333
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:26,012
strike up a conversation.
Then what?

334
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:29,446
Okay, let's say there are
100 people in this car.

335
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,846
There are
16 personality types,

336
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,446
as defined by psychology.

337
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:35,780
And so I can assume
that there are about

338
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,312
six people of each type,

339
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:38,979
with varying
degrees of response

340
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:41,146
to any particular situation.

341
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:45,047
My job is to answer
one basic question.

342
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,412
-What's that?
-What kind of person are you?

343
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:51,413
Me? You should
probably ask my wife.

344
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:57,278
-Let's do an experiment.
-Experiment?

345
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:58,279
It's painless.

346
00:18:58,312 --> 00:18:59,814
It's just a simple
hypothetical question.

347
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:02,913
Okay.

348
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:11,778
What if I asked you
to do one little thing?

349
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:18,079
It's something that you are
uniquely qualified to do.

350
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:20,912
It's something
that's meaningless to you,

351
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:24,413
but it could profoundly affect
an individual on this train.

352
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:26,879
Would you do it?

353
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:29,378
I'd want to know
what kind of thing.

354
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,911
-Does it matter?
-Well, I think it does.

355
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:33,011
And you would never know

356
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:34,278
the consequences
of what you did.

357
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,179
Then why would I do it?

358
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,046
Because there
would be a reward.

359
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,244
A-ha.

360
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,778
So, What's the reward?

361
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:57,445
In the bathroom, carriage two,

362
00:19:57,477 --> 00:20:02,177
maybe there is a package.
It's hidden,

363
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:08,111
and inside that package
is $25,000.

364
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:11,912
That money is yours,
plus another 75 cash,

365
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,446
if you do
this one little thing.

366
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,311
I don't understand.

367
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:22,745
Someone on this train
does not belong.

368
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:26,312
All you have to do
is find them. That's it.

369
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,778
This person is carrying a bag.

370
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,111
You don't know
what it looks like.

371
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:33,812
But inside that bag
is something they have stolen.

372
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,777
This person goes
by the name of Prynne.

373
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,877
It's not a real name.

374
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:43,812
They will be on this train
until Cold Spring.

375
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:49,045
You find them,
you find the bag,

376
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:50,778
that $100,000 is yours.

377
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,277
Don't leave the train
before finding the bag.

378
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,778
Don't tell anyone
about this offer.

379
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,911
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

380
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:00,009
Simple.

381
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:01,812
I thought
this was hypothetical.

382
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,177
It's just one little thing.

383
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,410
It shouldn't be too hard
for an ex-cop.

384
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:07,910
<i>-Wait.
-Arriving at...</i>

385
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,144
<i>-How did you know...
- ...86th Street Station.</i>

386
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:11,910
-That's me.
-You're being serious, right?

387
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:15,810
You have until
the next stop to decide.

388
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,810
What kind of person are you?

389
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,843
<i>Now leaving
86th Street Station.</i>

390
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:33,877
What?

391
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:07,042
You're kidding me.

392
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:36,908
Tickets, anybody? Ticket?

393
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:08,508
Excuse me.

394
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,774
You're gonna
wanna move on, pal.

395
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:11,040
The AC's out in here.

396
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,274
Actually, I was hoping
you could help me.

397
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:15,507
I'm looking for someone.
A friend.

398
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,107
Okay.

399
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:18,907
They're going to Cold Spring,

400
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,307
and I was wondering
if you keep track

401
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:23,441
of where everyone
gets on and off the train.

402
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:27,374
Yeah, I take pictures,
I hand out surveys, you know.

403
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:29,107
I didn't mean it like that.

404
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:31,841
Dude, it's tickets
and zones, okay?

405
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:32,974
They buy a ticket
for a station,

406
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:36,740
I punch the zone stub
and put it on the seat. Boom.

407
00:24:38,307 --> 00:24:41,873
Is that just day riders or...

408
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:43,140
You said you're looking
for your friend, right?

409
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:44,174
Yeah.

410
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:45,372
You don't know
what they look like?

411
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:47,141
You're asking me questions

412
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:50,141
about passengers,
about protocol?

413
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:54,041
I know, it's stupid.
We only talked online.

414
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:57,306
She said she'd be here.
Lives in Cold Spring.

415
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:59,306
You're meeting an online date?

416
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:02,207
On a metro train?

417
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:08,173
Yeah, I can't help you, pal.
No one can.

418
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:11,407
-Okay.
-All right.

419
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,440
You take it easy. Good luck.

420
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,873
<i>Now arriving
110th Street Station, folks.</i>

421
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:48,039
You Michael?
Michael MacCauley?

422
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:50,005
Yeah.

423
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,272
You found
what you're looking for?

424
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,040
What?

425
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:57,939
Yo. Are we doing this?

426
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:01,372
No. No, I can't.

427
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:04,305
Yeah, they thought
you might say that.

428
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:07,739
-Wait a minute. What is this?
-It's a warning.

429
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:08,873
In case you haven't
figured it out yet,

430
00:26:08,906 --> 00:26:10,039
they're watching you.

431
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:17,438
<i>Now leaving
110th Street Station.</i>

432
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,905
<i>Next stop,
125th Street Station.</i>

433
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,005
-Tony, can I use your phone?
-What?

434
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:51,139
Your phone. Mine was stolen.
I have to make a call.

435
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:54,171
It's an emergency.
Please. Please.

436
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:57,039
Yeah, okay.
There's no service till 125th.

437
00:26:57,071 --> 00:26:58,404
Sometimes in the back,
if you're lucky.

438
00:26:58,437 --> 00:26:59,738
Thanks, Tony.

439
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:01,171
Don't quit outta my game.

440
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:10,438
You figure out
who she was?

441
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,738
The woman we saw earlier
that was eyeballing you.

442
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:16,405
I figured
that's where you went,

443
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:17,705
looking for her.

444
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:22,404
Hey, no judgment. I mean...

445
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:30,903
Mind if I borrow
the sports section?

446
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:34,171
-No. Yeah, sure. Here.
-Thanks.

447
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:36,371
The Yanks are playing the Sox.

448
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,171
Five wins to clinch.
I'm feeling very confident.

449
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:48,004
You know, my boy,

450
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:49,504
he won't let me
watch it on TV.

451
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:53,737
He says it's bad
for my blood pressure.

452
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:56,738
As if the Yanks winning would give
me a heart attack or something.

453
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,304
Don't know why the kid
is so worried.

454
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,270
Kid spends more time watching
me than he does at work.

455
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:05,471
Yeah, and that is what I get

456
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:08,269
for teaching the kid
to do the right thing.

457
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:10,437
Listen, I'm gonna stop
by a bar and get a beer.

458
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:14,437
-Why don't you come with me?
-I can't.

459
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:19,904
I gotta make a call.

460
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:32,736
Come on, Karen, pick up.

461
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,903
<i>The mobile number you are
trying to reach is unavailable.</i>

<i>-2-3 Precinct.

466
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:48,036
It's an emergency.
I'm a friend.

467
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:51,837
Hey, Murph. It's Michael.

468
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:55,402
Listen, I'm on the train
just before Harlem.

469
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,802
I don't know
what the hell's happening.

470
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:01,870
This woman
approached me out of nowhere.

471
00:29:01,903 --> 00:29:03,737
She wants me
to find a passenger

472
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:05,737
carrying some kind of bag.

473
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,235
Murph, I think I've...

474
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:09,870
Just send someone to my house

475
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:11,904
and call me back
at this number, okay?

476
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:24,302
<i>Now arriving
125th Street Station, folks.</i>

477
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:27,436
I'll see you
on the next go-round.

478
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,801
<i>Now leaving
125th Street Station.</i>

479
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:42,835
<i>Next stop, Yankee Stadium,
folks, Yankee Stadium.</i>

480
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,135
Murph? Hello?

481
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:53,102
<i>You accepted
the offer, Michael,</i>

482
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:55,135
<i>and then you broke the rules.</i>

483
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,367
<i>Sorry, folks.
We're stopping due to a red signal.</i>

484
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:59,802
<i>We should be on our way
in just a few minutes.</i>

485
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:01,869
What the hell is this?

486
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:06,002
<i>Look outside. Corner of MLK
and Lexington. Quickly, now.</i>

487
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:07,035
<i>Southeast corner.</i>

488
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:18,368
What do you want from me?

489
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:21,435
<i>I want you to accept
responsibility.</i>

490
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,735
<i>We all suffer
the burden of choice.</i>

491
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:26,302
<i>No one forced you
to take that money.</i>

492
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:27,335
<i>Do you see him?</i>

493
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:34,901
<i>We can't have your friends
talking to the police.</i>

494
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,436
<i>-I didn't tell him anything.
-We both know that's not true.</i>

495
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,034
Somebody get some help!

496
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:51,268
My God.
What have you done?

497
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:53,368
<i>You did this.
You made your choice.</i>

498
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,000
<i>Find Prynne. Find the bag.</i>

499
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:59,268
<i>Or there will be further
consequences.</i>

500
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:01,801
-Did you see what happened?
-You listen to me. Listen.

501
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,467
<i>No, you listen.
I can get to anyone anywhere.</i>

502
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,401
<i>Your wife Karen,
your son Danny.</i>

503
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:11,000
You touch my wife, my son,
I swear to God...

504
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,967
<i>I asked you to do
one little thing.</i>

505
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:15,133
<i>Don't make it
more complicated than that.</i>

506
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,867
<i>Don't make me
hurt someone you love.</i>

507
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:20,734
Wait, wait, wait.

508
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:23,133
The day riders all have ticket
stubs in the back of their seats.

509
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,768
I can narrow down
which passengers

510
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,267
are going to Cold Spring.

511
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,133
<i>-Now we're getting somewhere.
-What's in the bag?</i>

512
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,400
What do I do when I find it?

513
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,201
<i>Check your
right jacket pocket.</i>

514
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,734
<i>-Do you know what that is?
-It's a GPS tracker.</i>

515
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:39,999
<i>Clearly your time as a police
officer wasn't for nothing.</i>

516
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,401
<i>Plant the device on the bag,
and it's all over.</i>

517
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:44,401
<i>Dobbs Ferry Station,</i>

518
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,999
<i>that's three stops,
arrives 7:00 p.m.</i>

519
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:49,000
<i>-And, Michael?
-What?</i>

520
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,033
<i>Give the gentleman
back his phone.</i>

521
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:57,999
Do you know
who's sitting here?

522
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,732
Excuse me. Does this train
go to Tenmile River?

523
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,933
-Yeah.
-I thought that.

524
00:33:11,966 --> 00:33:13,033
Thank you.

525
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,432
<i>Now arriving
Yankee Stadium, folks.</i>

526
00:33:56,464 --> 00:33:57,964
<i>Yankee Stadium.</i>

527
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:17,164
Couldn't help
but overhear earlier.

528
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:19,797
You're a broker, right?

529
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,330
Can I help you with something?

530
00:34:22,363 --> 00:34:24,297
I haven't seen you
on the train before.

531
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:26,832
There's a reason for that.

532
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:31,865
You riding for business or...

533
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:34,797
Well, I... My wife and I
are getting ready to retire,

534
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:37,163
and we're looking
for a new broker.

535
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:39,263
I work for one of the largest
investment banks in the world.

536
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:40,464
Great. That's exactly...

537
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:42,231
We don't represent
people like you.

538
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:46,231
You're headed to Cold Spring.

539
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:50,163
I figured maybe you were
seeing a client out there.

540
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:51,831
What makes you think
I'm going to Cold Spring?

541
00:34:53,163 --> 00:34:54,763
-I don't know.
-What's your deal, man?

542
00:34:55,498 --> 00:34:56,731
Let me guess.

543
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,197
The suit,
the shoes, the watch.

544
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,630
You've probably
worked sales the last 20 years

545
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:03,830
and now you wanna turn your nest egg
into a three-week timeshare in Maui.

546
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:22,731
Yeah.

547
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:24,130
No, you got me
on a train to nowhere.

548
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:26,196
Seriously, I never should
have left Goldman Sachs.

549
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:27,797
Hey, Goldman Sachs.

550
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:30,897
On behalf of the American
middle class, fuck you.

551
00:35:34,897 --> 00:35:37,129
Sorry, Ma. Go ahead.

552
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:38,297
No, it was nothing.

553
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,430
-Long day, Sherri?
-Yeah.

554
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,263
But you've been busy,

555
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:54,429
up and down
the aisle the whole time.

556
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:56,729
Karen's been on at me
to get more exercise.

557
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,963
It's either the train
or Pilates.

558
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:03,729
-How is the family?
-Good. Good.

559
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,995
Danny's headed off
to Syracuse.

560
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:07,462
You must be really proud.

561
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:09,863
Yeah. He's trying to decide

562
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:11,795
between the dorms
or an apartment,

563
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:13,929
the dorms or an apartment...

564
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:17,428
Excuse me. Hello?

565
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:22,795
You go to Columbia, right?
T-shirt.

566
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:26,829
Are you a photography student?
I noticed your camera case.

567
00:36:29,895 --> 00:36:31,897
I don't know... I'm sorry.

568
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:37,797
Millennials?

569
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,029
Excuse me.
Could you just wait?

570
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:48,061
<i>-Now arriving Dobbs Ferry.
-Hey.</i>

571
00:36:48,095 --> 00:36:49,296
I only wanna talk.

572
00:36:49,328 --> 00:36:51,794
Jeez!

573
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:55,163
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

574
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:56,995
What is this?

575
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:58,861
Nothing. Can you just...
Stop it.

576
00:36:58,894 --> 00:36:59,727
Fake IDs?

577
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,061
They're not mine,
I swear to God.

578
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,128
They're my boyfriend's,

579
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:04,729
and he asked me
if I could carry it

580
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:06,761
because he would get caught.

581
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,894
Are you a cop?

582
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,262
No, I'm not a cop.

583
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,262
But, listen,
if he really cared about you,

584
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:15,895
he wouldn't ask you
to do something like this.

585
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:18,894
Yeah, okay.

586
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:20,794
<i>Now leaving Dobbs Ferry.</i>

587
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:22,828
<i>Next stop, Tarrytown.</i>

588
00:37:47,826 --> 00:37:49,128
Are you sure?

589
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,728
Maybe it's nothing.

590
00:37:50,762 --> 00:37:53,295
Look, they were all sitting
together, three of them.

591
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:55,395
-Right.
-At 125th they split up,

592
00:37:55,428 --> 00:37:57,194
each to a different car.

593
00:37:57,228 --> 00:37:59,261
I don't know, it felt weird.

594
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:01,194
I'm only authorized
to search a bag

595
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:02,760
if it's been left behind.

596
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:04,461
You know
I ride this line every day.

597
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,395
Like I said,
maybe it's nothing,

598
00:38:06,428 --> 00:38:09,761
but "see something,
say something," right?

599
00:38:09,793 --> 00:38:12,094
-You point 'em out to me?
-Yeah.

600
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:19,027
The woman there.

601
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:20,861
The nurse.

602
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:22,060
Man in the second car,

603
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,060
African-American,
with a guitar.

604
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:27,428
Another in the last car.
All going to Cold Spring.

605
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:52,326
Excuse me, ma'am.

606
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,727
I have to carry out
some random security checks,

607
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:57,193
and I just need to take
a look in your bag.

608
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:58,660
Why?

609
00:38:58,694 --> 00:38:59,794
I just need to take
a look in your bag.

610
00:38:59,827 --> 00:39:01,827
Hey, hey, hey! What do
you think you're doing?

611
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,494
-It's a random security check.
-I know my rights.

612
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:04,593
Get back to your books.

613
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,759
I just need to take
a look in your bag, ma'am.

614
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:11,126
Why me?
Seriously, why me? Why my bag?

615
00:39:12,194 --> 00:39:13,493
You're disturbing
everybody, ma'am.

616
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:14,892
Please just keep it down.

617
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:17,194
Now, please,
just open your bag.

618
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:19,793
I asked you nicely, ma'am.

619
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,827
-Just, please, open your bag.
-I'm a nurse. Come on.

620
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,927
Sorry, sir.

621
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
I help people.
I don't kill them.

622
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:26,959
I just told you, ma'am,
it's a random security check.

623
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,194
Do me a favor, will you?

624
00:39:28,226 --> 00:39:29,960
Just open your bag.
I'm sorry, sir.

625
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,061
Just open up your bag,
and I'll be on my way.

626
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:41,126
Got a visual, but I
can't get to anything yet.

627
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:42,893
I just need a bit more time.

628
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:55,326
-Who are you?
-Calm down.

629
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:56,759
Why are you following me?

630
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,493
Are you the reason
they're searching passengers?

631
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:03,225
-Prynne?
-What did you say?

632
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,759
Who are you? What do you know?

633
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,257
What...

634
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,224
Whatever you think
you're doing,

635
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:39,291
you know what's good for you,
let it go.

636
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,258
Hey, man, are you okay?

637
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:48,893
Yeah.

638
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:59,991
You see that? Scumbag.
Tried to steal my wallet.

639
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:15,292
This train's freaking me out.

640
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:39,991
Hello? What?

641
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:43,858
Who is this?

642
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,892
All right.

643
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:57,157
Mike, it's for you.
Some guy says he's a cop.

644
00:41:59,357 --> 00:42:01,823
You don't look so good.
Everything all right?

645
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:03,856
Give me a minute, will you?

646
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:06,423
<i>-Murph.
-Mike.</i>

647
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,957
You sent someone to the house?

648
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,323
<i>Tarrytown local.
They're on their way.</i>

649
00:42:10,357 --> 00:42:12,924
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

650
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:14,957
<i>Mike?</i>

651
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,090
This woman sits across from
me, calls herself Joanna.

652
00:42:18,123 --> 00:42:21,956
She offers me 100 grand
to find someone on the train.

653
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:26,324
<i>-They want his bag.
-100 grand? What kind of bag?</i>

654
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:30,191
I don't know.
Look, it sounds crazy.

655
00:42:30,223 --> 00:42:32,023
They threatened
Karen and Danny.

656
00:42:32,056 --> 00:42:34,289
They killed a man, Murph,
pushed him into the street.

657
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:39,024
<i>Jesus Christ. Okay.
You still on the train?</i>

658
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,456
<i>-Yeah.
-All right, don't do anything.</i>

659
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,123
<i>I'm gonna call a friend at
the transportation authority.</i>

660
00:42:44,155 --> 00:42:46,356
I found him, Murph.
I didn't have a choice.

661
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:49,489
<i>-What did you do?
-They gave me a GPS tracker.</i>

662
00:42:49,522 --> 00:42:52,089
The kid's late 20s,
black duffle bag.

663
00:42:52,122 --> 00:42:54,323
A snake-head tattoo
on his neck.

664
00:42:54,356 --> 00:42:56,956
Goes by the name of Prynne.

665
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:58,823
<i>Prynne?</i>

666
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:00,856
<i>Did you take the money, Mike?</i>

667
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,822
<i>You want my help
as a detective or as a friend?</i>

668
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:08,723
<i>'Cause it's two very
different things.</i>

669
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,788
What are you
not telling me, Murph?

670
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,889
<i>Two nights ago,</i>

671
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:14,956
<i>a buddy of mine in the ninth
caught a suicide downtown,</i>

672
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:17,389
<i>a staffer in the city
planning office.</i>

673
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:19,723
<i>It's all over the news.</i>

674
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:23,289
<i>Thing is, this kid was in deep
with the wrong kind of people.</i>

675
00:43:24,455 --> 00:43:26,756
<i>There's a witness
who saw two guys</i>

676
00:43:26,788 --> 00:43:28,755
<i>drop him 35 stories
out a window.</i>

677
00:43:30,222 --> 00:43:32,022
<i>Witness goes by Prynne.</i>

678
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,056
And I identified him.

679
00:43:35,088 --> 00:43:38,055
Someone on this train's
gonna kill him. Jesus.

680
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:39,755
I had an altercation
with the guy.

681
00:43:39,788 --> 00:43:41,254
I got a bag full of cash.

682
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:43,289
I just lost my job.

683
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,923
She's trying to set me up.

684
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:48,354
<i>All right, this is
what you're gonna do.</i>

685
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:50,722
<i>Next stop, get...</i>

686
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:55,689
Murph? Hello? Murph?

687
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,188
You done?

688
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,855
Come on, man. What the
hell is wrong with you?

689
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:05,955
Sorry, Tony. Thanks.

690
00:44:05,987 --> 00:44:08,789
Great. Thanks for using
my battery up, asshole.

691
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,987
Why are we meeting
a witness outside the city?

692
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:20,056
It feels wrong.

693
00:44:21,955 --> 00:44:23,922
Twenty minutes.

694
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:26,389
All right. I'm checking in
with Agent Foster.

695
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:28,821
As long as the witness
gets off that train.

696
00:44:58,286 --> 00:44:59,754
Everything all right?

697
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,920
<i>Look what you did, Michael.</i>

698
00:46:42,953 --> 00:46:44,020
<i>Another dead passenger.</i>

699
00:46:46,953 --> 00:46:48,386
This man was a federal agent.

700
00:46:48,418 --> 00:46:51,318
<i>Yes, but he's not Prynne.
You marked the wrong man.</i>

701
00:46:51,352 --> 00:46:53,719
<i>-You killed him.
-Whose fault is that?</i>

702
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:56,085
<i>-I didn't agree to this.
-You tell yourself that.</i>

703
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:57,485
<i>I know you think
you're a good man,</i>

704
00:46:57,518 --> 00:46:59,319
<i>but some part of you
was willing.</i>

705
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:02,085
<i>Some part of you capable
of condemning a stranger</i>

706
00:47:02,118 --> 00:47:03,219
<i>to an unknown fate.</i>

707
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:04,852
I'm done playing games.

708
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:12,318
<i>The mobile
number you are trying to...</i>

709
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:14,885
<i>-Shit.
- ...reach is unavailable.</i>

710
00:47:18,051 --> 00:47:19,251
I wanna talk to my wife.

711
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:20,851
<i>Stay with me, Michael.</i>

712
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:22,352
<i>You still have a job to do.</i>

713
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:23,884
I will not do a goddamn thing

714
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:26,951
until I know my wife
and my son are okay.

715
00:47:26,984 --> 00:47:28,986
<i>They're just leaving
the house now.</i>

716
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:34,484
<i>Mom, come on.
We're gonna be late.</i>

717
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,819
<i>Danny,
have you seen my ring?</i>

718
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:39,118
<i>I swear I left it
on the bathroom counter.</i>

719
00:47:41,084 --> 00:47:42,452
<i>Have you asked Dad?</i>

720
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,984
<i>He's not
picking up his phone as usual.</i>

721
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,119
<i>Mom, who is that?</i>

722
00:47:51,284 --> 00:47:54,819
<i>Danny, get in the car.
Lock the door.</i>

723
00:47:56,485 --> 00:47:58,052
<i>Can I help you?</i>

724
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,884
<i>-Are you Karen MacCauley?
-Yes.</i>

725
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:04,317
<i>I'm here because
of your husband.</i>

726
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,251
<i>I'm sorry. Do I know...</i>

727
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:14,150
<i>You have
a beautiful family, Michael.</i>

728
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,317
<i>Now arriving Tarrytown.</i>

729
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,318
There are police
on their way right now.

730
00:48:18,351 --> 00:48:19,218
If your men try anything...

731
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,351
<i>Yes, they were, Michael.
They were.</i>

732
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:23,018
<i>Until you called too much
attention to yourself.</i>

733
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:24,918
<i>-What?
-Look outside.</i>

734
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:27,718
<i>Someone reported a dangerous
individual on the train.</i>

735
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,150
<i>Now you're standing over
a corpse. Do the math.</i>

736
00:48:31,184 --> 00:48:32,284
What do you want me to do?

737
00:48:32,317 --> 00:48:35,418
<i>Don't leave the train
and don't get caught.</i>

738
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:03,883
<i>I've been doing this
a long time.</i>

739
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:05,484
I'm telling you,
he's a regular.

740
00:49:05,517 --> 00:49:06,717
I don't think he's dangerous.

741
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:09,717
The guy claims he's looking
for someone onboard, right?

742
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,483
He makes up
some bullshit story

743
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:13,349
about suspicious bags,

744
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:15,116
and then he gets into a fight.

745
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,983
<i>Sorry for the delay, folks.</i>

746
00:50:07,015 --> 00:50:08,784
<i>We'll be on our way very soon.</i>

747
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:12,783
Compartments
one and two all clear.

748
00:50:12,816 --> 00:50:14,316
-Call the captain.
-Yes, sir.

749
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:16,916
Got two and three clear.
Three and four clear.

750
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:19,116
Compartments
five and six clear.

751
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:20,450
No, he's not here.

752
00:50:20,482 --> 00:50:22,116
Okay, wrap it up, boys.

753
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:34,314
<i>That was impressive, Michael.</i>

754
00:52:34,346 --> 00:52:36,047
<i>I almost thought
you were gonna miss the train.</i>

755
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,846
I wanna talk
to my wife and my son.

756
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,914
I wanna know they're safe.

757
00:52:38,946 --> 00:52:41,080
<i>There are two more stops
before Cold Spring.</i>

758
00:52:41,113 --> 00:52:42,814
<i>Garrison Station
is your last chance,</i>

759
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:44,980
<i>if you ever wanna
talk to them again.</i>

760
00:52:45,013 --> 00:52:47,847
I need more time.
There isn't enough to go on.

761
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:49,479
<i>You've proven
yourself capable.</i>

762
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:50,880
<i>Figure it out.</i>

763
00:53:12,746 --> 00:53:14,245
Hey, Manny, AC's cut out.

764
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,846
I'm gonna check
the hub in three.

765
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,080
<i>-Copy that.
-Hi. Excuse me.</i>

766
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:18,814
It's, like,
90 degrees in here.

767
00:53:18,847 --> 00:53:20,979
Yeah, working on it, ma'am.
Working on it.

768
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:22,480
Tarrytown.
I thought you got off.

769
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:24,013
Sam.

770
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,979
You lucky son of a bitch.

771
00:53:32,012 --> 00:53:35,112
My dad said it pays
to make new friends.

772
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,146
-You wanna go again?
-Yep.

773
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:49,346
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure you've noticed</i>

774
00:53:49,379 --> 00:53:52,713
<i>we've lost AC in all cars
except the last one.</i>

775
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:54,213
<i>If you wanna move, please,</i>

776
00:53:54,245 --> 00:53:56,180
<i>remember your belongings.
Thank you.</i>

777
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:57,379
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure you've noticed

778
00:53:57,412 --> 00:54:00,778
we've entered the seventh
circle of hell. God damn it.

779
00:54:20,378 --> 00:54:23,413
Gonna be a hell of a ride
to Cold Spring.

780
00:54:35,245 --> 00:54:38,945
All right.
Two pairs. Queens. Fours.

781
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:42,079
-Hey, Tony, deal me in?
-Your money to lose, pal.

782
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:43,413
Come on in, Mike.

783
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:47,211
I got 100 to my name.

784
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:48,379
All right, Texas hold 'em.

785
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:49,879
-Good?
-Sure.

786
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,145
Okay. Gentlemen.

787
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:56,112
Take a peek.

788
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:07,712
-Doing all right there, pal?
-You don't wanna know.

789
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:08,977
You should have got off
two stops ago.

790
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,243
Ten years I ride this train.

791
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:12,845
Maybe one time I wanna see
the end of the line.

792
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:15,144
-Why?
-What about you, friend?

793
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:17,811
What about me?

794
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:20,011
Never seen you
on this train before.

795
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:22,812
Well, I've never
seen you either.

796
00:55:22,844 --> 00:55:25,010
-You're not a regular.
-What is that to you?

797
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:29,977
All right.

798
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,843
I think your friend here's
got a problem with me.

799
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:34,244
-Relax.
-Just making conversation.

800
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:35,344
That's all.

801
00:55:35,376 --> 00:55:37,944
Well, if you wanna
say something,

802
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:40,877
why don't you say it?

803
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:45,310
It just occurred to me
that most of us,

804
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:46,777
we ride this train every day.

805
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,711
We nod. We say hello.

806
00:55:49,743 --> 00:55:52,044
But how much do we really
know about each other?

807
00:55:52,076 --> 00:55:55,244
What about you, Mike?
What do we know about you?

808
00:55:55,276 --> 00:55:56,843
Fair enough.

809
00:55:56,876 --> 00:55:58,843
I got fired today.

810
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:02,977
Yeah. Didn't have the guts
to tell my wife.

811
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:05,843
Yeah. Have to go home,
look my son in the eye.

812
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:07,443
What am I supposed to say?

813
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:10,376
"I'm not the man
you thought I was"?

814
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,877
What kind of father?
What kind of husband?

815
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:18,977
60 years old.
What have I got left to offer?

816
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,710
-That was extremely honest.
-And I thought my life sucked.

817
00:56:22,743 --> 00:56:24,109
Are we gonna play or what?

818
00:56:24,143 --> 00:56:26,210
Right.

819
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,943
I'm out.

820
00:56:29,976 --> 00:56:33,177
So, I heard something
earlier today,

821
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,177
a hypothetical question.

822
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,809
What was the question?

823
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:39,710
What if someone asked you
to do one little thing,

824
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:41,209
something that's
meaningless to you,

825
00:56:41,242 --> 00:56:43,842
but would affect another
passenger on this train?

826
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:46,809
Would you do it?

827
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:48,309
I don't know.
What's in it for me?

828
00:56:48,342 --> 00:56:50,709
$100,000.

829
00:56:50,743 --> 00:56:51,709
Absolutely.

830
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,076
You don't
even know what it is.

831
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,176
It doesn't matter. Come on.

832
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:58,377
So what is
that one little thing?

833
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,809
A passenger on this train
doesn't belong.

834
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:01,976
They're carrying a bag,

835
00:57:02,009 --> 00:57:03,243
but you don't know
what it looks like.

836
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:04,943
All you have to do

837
00:57:04,975 --> 00:57:07,342
is find them
before they get off.

838
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:10,177
That's it?
It's not much to go on, Mike.

839
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,242
Tell me about it.

840
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:13,475
What happens
when you find 'em?

841
00:57:13,508 --> 00:57:16,144
They die. Hypothetically.

842
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,375
So what would you do, Mike?

843
00:57:19,408 --> 00:57:22,241
I'd get all the people
left on the train in one car,

844
00:57:22,274 --> 00:57:24,776
propose that very scenario.

845
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:25,976
No, no, no, no.

846
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:27,275
I mean, would you
take the money?

847
00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:35,008
You know what? I already did.

848
00:57:37,408 --> 00:57:41,208
-You see, I count five.
-Five what?

849
00:57:41,241 --> 00:57:43,442
Five people left
that don't belong.

850
00:57:43,476 --> 00:57:45,975
Five people on this train
that I've never seen before.

851
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:47,041
The lady right here.

852
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:51,974
The young girl with the
pink hair at the window.

853
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:54,041
Mr. Goldman Sachs over there.

854
00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:56,375
My friend with the guitar.

855
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,276
And you.

856
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:06,176
I'm Jackson.

857
00:58:10,475 --> 00:58:12,842
-You know what I would do?
-Tell me.

858
00:58:12,874 --> 00:58:15,041
I would pocket that 100 grand,

859
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,175
find the guy,

860
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:18,942
tell him to
take a different train.

861
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:24,008
All right.

862
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:29,108
All in.

863
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:31,409
For real? All right.

864
00:58:37,742 --> 00:58:39,941
So, you never
answered the question.

865
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:40,974
What question?

866
00:58:41,006 --> 00:58:42,374
What are you doing
on this train?

867
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:44,708
Maybe I'm like you.

868
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:46,308
Maybe I wanna
see the end of the line.

869
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,141
Wait a minute. Excuse me.

870
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,974
I call.

871
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,875
This is a monthly pass.
You're a regular commuter.

872
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:58,008
Yeah. And I have a full house.

873
00:59:00,273 --> 00:59:02,674
-What do you have?
-That's it for me.

874
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,341
I'm sorry.

875
00:59:16,007 --> 00:59:18,808
So what if I'm this guy
you're talking about?

876
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,840
-Are you?
-If I was?

877
00:59:21,874 --> 00:59:24,041
Someone wants you dead.

878
00:59:24,073 --> 00:59:26,708
I can help you, but I
need to know what you know,

879
00:59:26,741 --> 00:59:28,240
why you're going
to Cold Spring,

880
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,039
what's in that case.

881
00:59:30,072 --> 00:59:33,039
-It's just a guitar.
-Open it.

882
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:35,174
You wanna help me?
Why should I trust you?

883
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:36,274
Open the case.

884
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,773
So what do we do now?

885
00:59:55,805 --> 00:59:59,339
You and I go to carriage one,
barricade ourselves inside.

886
00:59:59,373 --> 01:00:00,939
And then, what,
you gonna find this killer,

887
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,073
take him down yourself?

888
01:00:02,107 --> 01:00:03,374
Gonna try.

889
01:00:04,506 --> 01:00:07,007
Obviously, I'm not Prynne.

890
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,240
But you seem to have
figured that out already.

891
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:13,707
That's a left-handed guitar.

892
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,373
What's that got to do with it?

893
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,740
Hey, man, are you okay?

894
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,973
Yeah.

895
01:00:23,006 --> 01:00:24,406
The gun's in your right hand.

896
01:00:24,439 --> 01:00:27,173
Well, shit.

897
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,140
I guess that's why
she chose you.

898
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:33,072
Four passengers left.
Which one is it?

899
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:36,106
I don't know.

900
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:39,840
All you got to lose
and you don't know.

901
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:41,306
You killed that agent.

902
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:43,306
No, that's on you, man.

903
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:45,939
How much is she paying you
to kill the witness?

904
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:47,805
Same as you, I guess.

905
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,105
But that's not really
how it works out, is it?

906
01:00:50,139 --> 01:00:53,140
No matter how much they pay,
you always end up owing more.

907
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:58,139
Who's Prynne, Michael?
Tell me now.

908
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,939
No.

909
01:01:02,406 --> 01:01:05,306
You have no idea
who you're up against.

910
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:09,938
-Do you?
-Yes, Michael. I do.

911
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:15,006
-Drop it.
-Take it easy.

912
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:22,405
Turn around.

913
01:02:06,737 --> 01:02:08,472
Who's Prynne?

914
01:02:08,503 --> 01:02:11,072
-I don't know.
-You're lying.

915
01:02:50,403 --> 01:02:52,336
Don't be stupid. Stop.

916
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:54,370
Not until Prynne is dead.

917
01:02:56,403 --> 01:02:58,404
I can't let you do that.

918
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:53,102
<i>You're out of time.
Who's Prynne?</i>

919
01:03:53,136 --> 01:03:55,870
It doesn't matter.
Your guy is dead.

920
01:03:57,735 --> 01:03:59,735
<i>You have the gun?</i>

921
01:04:01,868 --> 01:04:04,236
<i>Take it, Michael.
Take the weapon.</i>

922
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:11,969
<i>Kill Prynne, retrieve the bag,
and your family lives.</i>

923
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:15,370
<i>-I am not gonna do this.
-You can't have it both ways.</i>

924
01:04:15,402 --> 01:04:19,069
<i>You can save the witness
or your family.</i>

925
01:04:19,103 --> 01:04:21,769
<i>You know who Prynne is,
don't you?</i>

926
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:23,835
<i>It's time to finish
what you started.</i>

927
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:31,102
<i>Now arriving Garrison, folks.</i>

928
01:04:31,136 --> 01:04:33,369
Hey, Mike, what happened
to the guy with the guitar?

929
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,069
He got off.

930
01:04:38,235 --> 01:04:40,169
I better not be staying at
a bed and breakfast this time.

931
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:41,802
No way.

932
01:04:49,134 --> 01:04:51,201
<i>Next stop, Cold Spring.</i>

933
01:04:51,235 --> 01:04:53,670
<i>This train terminates
at Cold Spring.</i>

934
01:05:12,934 --> 01:05:16,101
-All that's left is you.
-What?

935
01:05:19,102 --> 01:05:22,001
Why are you going
to Cold Spring?

936
01:05:22,034 --> 01:05:24,401
That's none of your business.

937
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:29,300
-What's in the bag?
-My God.

938
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:32,267
What is with you people
and my bag? Jeez.

939
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:34,301
-Hey.
-Prynne?

940
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:35,702
What are you doing?

941
01:05:35,735 --> 01:05:36,902
-Let go of me.
-I'm trying to help you.

942
01:05:36,935 --> 01:05:38,368
Seriously, come on,
do something.

943
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:40,035
-Who is that?
-What's your problem?

944
01:05:40,068 --> 01:05:41,234
Mike, you gotta
let the lady go.

945
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:42,468
You don't get it, do you?

946
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,301
She wants you dead.
You witnessed a murder.

947
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,968
You have something
that she wants,

948
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,401
something she's
willing to kill for.

949
01:05:47,433 --> 01:05:49,967
Okay, Mike, you gotta
let her go. Let the lady go.

950
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:51,067
-Mike.
-Hand me the phone.

951
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,134
Mike, come on.

952
01:05:52,168 --> 01:05:54,001
Don't move. Don't move.
Stay in your seats.

953
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,000
Please, hand me the phone.

954
01:06:22,499 --> 01:06:23,433
I don't...

955
01:06:23,467 --> 01:06:27,034
Look, I don't know
what your problem is,

956
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:31,034
but I am not the person
you're looking for, okay?

957
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:37,101
My... My boyfriend and I,
we had this huge fight

958
01:06:37,133 --> 01:06:41,134
because I wasn't sure about
staying here and us and...

959
01:06:42,734 --> 01:06:44,367
So when I finished my shift,

960
01:06:44,399 --> 01:06:47,000
I just didn't
wanna go home.

961
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:51,667
Forgive me. Take it. Take it.

962
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,868
I'm sorry.

963
01:06:55,866 --> 01:06:57,333
They're gonna kill my family.

964
01:06:58,733 --> 01:07:00,733
There's no one else.

965
01:07:02,133 --> 01:07:05,233
Six day riders.
Six ticket stubs.

966
01:07:06,265 --> 01:07:08,266
Six going to Cold Spring.

967
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:14,833
Except... One got off
at Garrison.

968
01:07:17,132 --> 01:07:22,366
Goldman Sachs.
He... He was in the aisle.

969
01:07:24,265 --> 01:07:25,799
Bye-bye.

970
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,334
He switched seats.

971
01:07:50,365 --> 01:07:51,867
Prynne.

972
01:07:53,131 --> 01:07:55,931
<i>Hester Prynne.
The Scarlet Letter. Of course.</i>

973
01:07:57,998 --> 01:07:59,667
You bought the ticket
to Cold Spring.

974
01:08:02,132 --> 01:08:04,899
End of the line.
Cold Spring coming up.

975
01:08:07,732 --> 01:08:09,433
<i>Is it done?</i>

976
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:11,299
<i>-Is it done?
-I will not do this.</i>

977
01:08:11,331 --> 01:08:12,765
<i>I thought
I had you figured out.</i>

978
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:13,866
<i>I really did.</i>

979
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:17,132
Manny?

980
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:18,831
<i>After all of this, you would
choose the life of a stranger</i>

981
01:08:18,865 --> 01:08:20,232
<i>over your own family?</i>

982
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:22,231
<i>You must think
you're some kind of a hero.</i>

983
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:23,698
I won't do this.

984
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,166
I won't do it.
I will not do this.

985
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,366
Manny, Manny,
we have a hostage situation.

986
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:29,332
<i>Calling dispatch.</i>

987
01:08:29,365 --> 01:08:31,431
<i>This is your
last chance, Michael.</i>

988
01:08:31,465 --> 01:08:32,765
<i>-Do it.
-No.</i>

989
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:34,031
<i>Prynne has evidence</i>

990
01:08:34,065 --> 01:08:35,364
<i>-of a conspiracy.
-That doesn't matter.</i>

991
01:08:35,398 --> 01:08:37,831
<i>The people I work for,
they will do anything</i>

992
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:39,031
<i>-to protect themselves.
-What?</i>

993
01:08:39,065 --> 01:08:40,230
<i>These are
very powerful people.</i>

994
01:08:40,264 --> 01:08:41,465
<i>They will do
whatever it takes.</i>

995
01:08:41,497 --> 01:08:42,664
They? Who?
Who are you talking about?

996
01:08:42,697 --> 01:08:45,231
<i>Even kill you, your family.
Everyone on that train.</i>

997
01:08:45,264 --> 01:08:46,465
<i>-Do you understand?
-Who's they?</i>

998
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:48,899
<i>You have made your choice.</i>

999
01:08:48,931 --> 01:08:50,698
Joanna, who are
you working for?

1000
01:08:50,732 --> 01:08:52,232
<i>Now everyone dies.</i>

1001
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:55,265
Hel...

1002
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,432
<i>Dispatch
is contacting the police.</i>

1003
01:08:59,464 --> 01:09:00,832
Stop the train.

1004
01:09:00,865 --> 01:09:02,098
Copy that.

1005
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:06,230
You want to live, you stop
this goddamn train now.

1006
01:09:06,264 --> 01:09:08,432
Pull the brake. Now.

1007
01:09:08,464 --> 01:09:11,997
All right.
Now, everyone, hang on.

1008
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,697
Yeah, thanks.

1009
01:09:24,731 --> 01:09:26,698
Train's less than
a minute away.

1010
01:09:26,731 --> 01:09:27,898
Marshal Service
is ready for us.

1011
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:29,098
Take the statement
at the safe house.

1012
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:31,231
No screwing around.

1013
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,364
-Why is it not stopping?
-I don't know.

1014
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,296
Sam, I swear,
I had nothing to do with this.

1015
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,931
-Manny.
-Man, that's not good.

1016
01:09:48,963 --> 01:09:50,330
My God.

1017
01:09:51,964 --> 01:09:56,197
Help me get this open.
It's jammed. Come on.

1018
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:10,364
The engineer's dead.
Cab door's jammed.

1019
01:10:10,397 --> 01:10:12,830
I can't access
the control panel.

1020
01:10:12,862 --> 01:10:14,697
Dispatch, do you copy?

1021
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,197
The brakes have malfunctioned.

1022
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,398
There's no way
to stop the train.

1023
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,829
You what?

1024
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:23,063
<i>We'll have
to clear the tracks.</i>

1025
01:10:23,097 --> 01:10:24,230
Roger.

1026
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,796
Dispatch is gonna
clear the tracks.

1027
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:26,729
What?

1028
01:10:26,763 --> 01:10:29,296
There's a curve
just before Beacon.

1029
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:31,096
Now, we hit it
at 70 miles an hour,

1030
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,963
we're gonna derail for sure.

1031
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:35,963
All the passengers
are in the last car.

1032
01:10:35,996 --> 01:10:39,197
-Can we detach it?
-We have to try. Come on.

1033
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:43,462
We gotta unhook the couplers.

1034
01:10:43,496 --> 01:10:45,763
There's a coupler
safety latch.

1035
01:10:45,795 --> 01:10:48,131
It can only be released
from underneath the car.

1036
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:53,362
Someone will have to pull
the knuckle pin,

1037
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:56,964
and one of us will have to go
down and release the latch.

1038
01:11:00,395 --> 01:11:02,262
No. No friggin' way.
I'm not going down there.

1039
01:11:02,295 --> 01:11:03,329
It's just outside...

1040
01:11:03,362 --> 01:11:04,829
I don't care. Shut up.
I'm not going down there.

1041
01:11:04,863 --> 01:11:06,296
Just outside
and down the ladder.

1042
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:08,463
-I'll do it.
-Yeah, you do it.

1043
01:11:08,495 --> 01:11:09,929
Look, you go
tell the passengers

1044
01:11:09,961 --> 01:11:11,295
to brace themselves.

1045
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:12,228
I'll do that.

1046
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:18,296
We got about two minutes.
You make them count.

1047
01:11:18,328 --> 01:11:21,029
Stay calm.
Stay calm, okay? Stay calm.

1048
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:23,362
-Remain calm.
-Why?

1049
01:11:23,395 --> 01:11:24,762
I don't have time
to argue with you, lady.

1050
01:11:24,794 --> 01:11:26,162
Sit down. Take your seats.

1051
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:29,062
-Everyone, sit down. Sit down.
-I am sitting down.

1052
01:12:27,395 --> 01:12:28,728
Yeah!

1053
01:12:41,728 --> 01:12:43,728
The chain is caught.

1054
01:12:56,728 --> 01:12:58,795
You need more leverage.
I'll get the ax.

1055
01:13:13,126 --> 01:13:14,360
Between the train
and the people,

1056
01:13:14,393 --> 01:13:16,727
I always knew
it would be the train.

1057
01:14:59,959 --> 01:15:02,159
All right. I'm okay.
You all right? Come on.

1058
01:15:02,192 --> 01:15:04,425
-Get that door open.
-Everyone okay?

1059
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,959
-We gotta get out.
-Open the door.

1060
01:15:06,992 --> 01:15:09,325
Stay calm.
Don't get off the train.

1061
01:15:09,357 --> 01:15:11,024
Please, listen.

1062
01:15:11,058 --> 01:15:12,393
-Get the door open.
-We gotta get out.

1063
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:19,091
Jackson, close the door.
This isn't over yet.

1064
01:15:19,124 --> 01:15:22,159
We're still in danger.
Everyone grab a newspaper.

1065
01:15:22,191 --> 01:15:25,425
Cover the windows.
Use water, soda, anything.

1066
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:26,825
Mike, this is crazy.

1067
01:15:26,857 --> 01:15:29,659
Come on, get some water.
Cover the windows.

1068
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:44,757
-Why are we doing this, Mike?
-Just do it.

1069
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,225
We don't know who's out there.

1070
01:15:46,257 --> 01:15:47,892
Who's watching.
They tried to kill us all.

1071
01:15:47,924 --> 01:15:49,025
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1072
01:15:54,257 --> 01:15:57,191
I know you're all scared,
but I need your help.

1073
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:59,291
None of you
can leave, not yet.

1074
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:02,691
Not until I know
everyone's safe.

1075
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:05,825
They murdered innocent people.
They derailed the train.

1076
01:16:05,857 --> 01:16:08,924
They did this.
All to find a witness.

1077
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:13,392
Something she has
that they want.

1078
01:16:15,857 --> 01:16:16,956
They said
if I didn't kill you,

1079
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,124
they would kill
my wife, my son.

1080
01:16:19,156 --> 01:16:20,056
But I would never.

1081
01:16:20,091 --> 01:16:22,692
I would never do
what these people want.

1082
01:16:22,724 --> 01:16:24,290
I need your help.

1083
01:16:24,324 --> 01:16:26,190
I need to know
why they want you dead.

1084
01:16:32,391 --> 01:16:35,091
-What's your name?
-Sofia.

1085
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,657
Sofia.

1086
01:16:38,091 --> 01:16:40,858
It's okay. Come here.

1087
01:16:49,357 --> 01:16:51,990
I'm not going to let them
hurt you, okay?

1088
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:54,723
Can you show me
what's in your bag?

1089
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,090
This? This is what they want?

1090
01:17:12,356 --> 01:17:13,691
Do you know why?

1091
01:17:13,724 --> 01:17:16,057
Because of Enrique.

1092
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:17,323
It was his.

1093
01:17:17,355 --> 01:17:20,289
The guy who threw himself
off the 35th floor?

1094
01:17:20,322 --> 01:17:22,690
Ricky didn't kill himself.

1095
01:17:22,724 --> 01:17:24,224
You were there when he died?

1096
01:17:28,255 --> 01:17:30,256
It's okay. Tell me.

1097
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,856
Tell me what you saw.

1098
01:17:36,723 --> 01:17:39,789
Ricky was a city planner,

1099
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:42,956
and some nights
he would have to work late,

1100
01:17:42,989 --> 01:17:46,923
so I would go to his office
to finish my homework.

1101
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:49,423
I was waiting
for Ricky by the elevator

1102
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,690
when these two men show up.

1103
01:17:52,722 --> 01:17:54,955
I didn't see their faces,

1104
01:17:54,988 --> 01:17:56,989
but they were
looking for Ricky.

1105
01:17:59,055 --> 01:18:02,189
I hid 'cause I didn't wanna
get him in trouble.

1106
01:18:04,222 --> 01:18:06,222
But they wanted
something from him.

1107
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:12,156
Then all of them
start yelling,

1108
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,355
and I hear this noise.

1109
01:18:14,388 --> 01:18:17,455
They were hurting him.
I could hear him screaming.

1110
01:18:17,488 --> 01:18:19,322
And he tells them
that he doesn't have it,

1111
01:18:19,355 --> 01:18:21,056
that it's back at his place.

1112
01:18:21,089 --> 01:18:23,356
-You took it.
-Of course I took it.

1113
01:18:23,388 --> 01:18:25,856
I wanted to help.

1114
01:18:28,854 --> 01:18:33,321
And then I look through the
doorway and I see this guy.

1115
01:18:33,354 --> 01:18:36,355
He's holding Ricky,
and he hits him,

1116
01:18:36,388 --> 01:18:39,722
and he says something
about being noble.

1117
01:18:40,321 --> 01:18:41,421
Noble?

1118
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,789
He says that doing the right
thing will get you killed,

1119
01:18:43,821 --> 01:18:46,821
and that there's no such thing
as being noble.

1120
01:18:47,354 --> 01:18:49,056
And then,

1121
01:18:50,822 --> 01:18:52,323
they just...

1122
01:18:59,122 --> 01:19:01,222
I didn't know what to do.

1123
01:19:02,387 --> 01:19:03,688
I know.

1124
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:06,088
I just took it and I ran.

1125
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:08,088
Why didn't you
call the police?

1126
01:19:08,122 --> 01:19:09,255
I couldn't call the police.

1127
01:19:10,722 --> 01:19:12,989
The men
who killed him were cops.

1128
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,021
My God.

1129
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:20,956
And the next day I just...
I went to a friend's,

1130
01:19:22,054 --> 01:19:24,155
and she knew
someone in the FBI.

1131
01:19:24,187 --> 01:19:25,953
This guy, Agent Garcia,

1132
01:19:25,987 --> 01:19:28,188
he says that
this drive is evidence,

1133
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,921
and that I'm a witness.

1134
01:19:29,953 --> 01:19:32,287
He says it's not safe for me
in the city anymore,

1135
01:19:32,321 --> 01:19:34,355
tells me to catch the 6:25

1136
01:19:34,387 --> 01:19:36,855
to Cold Spring,
and they'll protect me.

1137
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:41,687
-You told no one else?
-No.

1138
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:45,122
Your friend trusts
this Agent Garcia, yeah?

1139
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,121
I don't know.

1140
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:53,753
Someone out there
wants you to disappear.

1141
01:19:53,786 --> 01:19:57,854
And if it's not him... Who?

1142
01:20:11,786 --> 01:20:13,354
My God.

1143
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:26,821
Go, go, go.
Move, move, move.

1144
01:20:26,854 --> 01:20:27,855
What the hell?

1145
01:20:44,486 --> 01:20:45,687
<i>MacCauley.</i>

1146
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,787
<i>This is Captain
David Hawthorne.</i>

1147
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,053
<i>I'm in command.</i>

1148
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:56,086
Entrance clear.
Let's go, go, go, go.

1149
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,354
<i>We have the train surrounded.</i>

1150
01:20:59,386 --> 01:21:01,253
<i>There is nowhere
for you to go.</i>

1151
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:06,287
<i>Throw out your weapon.</i>

1152
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:07,820
<i>My men will come aboard.</i>

1153
01:21:07,853 --> 01:21:10,219
<i>They will escort
the hostages to safety.</i>

1154
01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:13,820
<i>-It's okay. Don't be alarmed.
- You will not be harmed.</i>

1155
01:21:13,852 --> 01:21:15,019
This is
normal police procedure.

1156
01:21:15,052 --> 01:21:17,952
It's okay.
You will all be safe.

1157
01:21:17,986 --> 01:21:19,986
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

1158
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:37,252
Jesus, there's
a friggin' army out there.

1159
01:21:43,219 --> 01:21:46,353
Agent Garcia, come to me.

1160
01:21:46,386 --> 01:21:49,153
I need tactical staged
and ready to breach, okay?

1161
01:21:49,186 --> 01:21:51,119
-Sir.
-Thanks.

1162
01:21:51,984 --> 01:21:53,985
Where's Overwatch?

1163
01:21:56,118 --> 01:21:58,218
<i>Overwatch, this is command.</i>

1164
01:21:58,252 --> 01:22:00,685
When you get line of sight,
I need to know.

1165
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:01,885
Roger.

1166
01:22:01,919 --> 01:22:04,386
-This is bad, Mike.
-It'll be fine, I promise.

1167
01:22:09,118 --> 01:22:12,218
<i>MacCauley,
you'have an old friend here.</i>

1168
01:22:12,251 --> 01:22:14,986
<i>He wants to come aboard,
and he wants to talk.</i>

1169
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:25,219
Your tag is lit.

1170
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:45,951
<i>We are live
outside the town of Beacon,</i>

1171
01:22:45,984 --> 01:22:48,185
<i>where a Hudson
North train has derailed.</i>

1172
01:22:48,217 --> 01:22:50,318
<i>No reports
of any casualties yet.</i>

1173
01:22:52,251 --> 01:22:53,352
Get back.

1174
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:54,885
Go, go, go. Move back.

1175
01:22:54,918 --> 01:22:56,386
Go, go.

1176
01:22:58,918 --> 01:23:00,918
We got sound
on Lieutenant Murphy.

1177
01:23:05,251 --> 01:23:06,251
<i>According to
our source on the ground,</i>

1178
01:23:06,284 --> 01:23:09,350
<i>an ex-NYPD officer
has taken over the train</i>

1179
01:23:09,383 --> 01:23:11,852
<i>and is holding
the passengers hostage.</i>

1180
01:23:16,851 --> 01:23:18,052
Hey, Mike,
how we doing in there?

1181
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,550
Listen, man,
you know how this goes.

1182
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:22,952
We don't work this out, SWAT's
gonna take the train by force.

1183
01:23:25,983 --> 01:23:27,117
Come on, talk to me, buddy.

1184
01:23:30,983 --> 01:23:32,216
Where's my family?

1185
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,483
You said police
were on their way.

1186
01:23:33,517 --> 01:23:35,418
<i>They were, man.
I don't know what happened.</i>

1187
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:38,017
Look, we're doing
the best we can.

1188
01:23:38,049 --> 01:23:39,916
You don't know
what's going on, Murph.

1189
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:41,883
Then tell me, all right?

1190
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,850
Just open the door, let me in.
I'm unarmed. I'm alone.

1191
01:23:52,816 --> 01:23:54,083
How many people
you got in there?

1192
01:23:56,917 --> 01:23:58,750
Mike, I wanna help you.
You gotta help me out.

1193
01:23:58,782 --> 01:24:01,283
If I don't produce results,
they're gonna pull me out.

1194
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:03,950
Now, how many
hostages do you have?

1195
01:24:03,983 --> 01:24:05,817
We gotta do something.

1196
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:07,385
Yeah, but what?
What can we do?

1197
01:24:08,817 --> 01:24:10,817
Fifteen, 20.

1198
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:13,450
All right, just let some go.
Whoever you want.

1199
01:24:13,482 --> 01:24:15,183
How do I know they'll be safe?

1200
01:24:16,849 --> 01:24:18,683
The hostages?

1201
01:24:18,717 --> 01:24:21,316
There's someone
I need to protect.

1202
01:24:21,349 --> 01:24:23,150
Look, if you're worried
about someone's safety,

1203
01:24:23,182 --> 01:24:24,349
just send them out with me.

1204
01:24:26,717 --> 01:24:28,684
Not yet.

1205
01:24:28,717 --> 01:24:30,083
No...

1206
01:24:32,816 --> 01:24:35,816
Seven years we were partners.
You always had my back.

1207
01:24:35,849 --> 01:24:37,850
Let someone else
have yours for once.

1208
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:42,250
Mike.

1209
01:24:44,183 --> 01:24:46,684
Look, I tell you what.
I'll make an exchange, okay?

1210
01:24:46,716 --> 01:24:49,782
Release some hostages
and take me instead.

1211
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:08,082
They're coming out.

1212
01:25:09,315 --> 01:25:12,049
Come on out.
Come on out.

1213
01:25:12,083 --> 01:25:13,416
Come on.
Come on. This way.

1214
01:25:13,448 --> 01:25:15,682
<i>Watch your step.
Go that way. Follow her.</i>

1215
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:16,983
All right, stay in line.

1216
01:25:17,016 --> 01:25:20,215
<i>Yes, it does appear that
hostages are being released.</i>

1217
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:23,816
<i>It is unclear at this time
how many remain on the train.</i>

1218
01:25:30,948 --> 01:25:33,216
-Is that it?
-Yeah. Come on.

1219
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:38,948
All right. Patrol's on
their way to your house.

1220
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:40,249
No sirens.

1221
01:25:46,147 --> 01:25:48,282
They have you tagged.

1222
01:25:48,314 --> 01:25:50,449
This goes on much longer,
they're gonna board.

1223
01:25:50,482 --> 01:25:52,216
They don't want a cop
caught in the crossfire.

1224
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,415
Come on, put the gun down.

1225
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:57,349
Jesus, I'm unarmed. Come on.

1226
01:26:05,781 --> 01:26:08,049
Tell them
to turn the lights off.

1227
01:26:08,081 --> 01:26:10,082
<i>Kill the lights.</i>

1228
01:26:10,715 --> 01:26:11,749
Cut the lights.

1229
01:26:15,481 --> 01:26:17,948
-Thanks, pal.
-Come on, you know the deal.

1230
01:26:17,981 --> 01:26:20,149
We lost audio.

1231
01:26:20,181 --> 01:26:22,882
You were right, there is
a witness on the train.

1232
01:26:22,914 --> 01:26:25,115
They were supposed to meet
the FBI at Cold Spring.

1233
01:26:25,148 --> 01:26:28,848
-FBI? Special Agent Garcia?
-You know?

1234
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,714
Hawthorne just pulled
jurisdiction from him.

1235
01:26:30,748 --> 01:26:32,415
Hawthorne. That figures.

1236
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,682
I want eyes on.
Confirm visuals.

1237
01:26:36,814 --> 01:26:39,180
<i>Friendly fire tag
is lit in blue.</i>

1238
01:26:39,213 --> 01:26:40,447
<i>Visual confirmed.</i>

1239
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,781
Mike, what the hell happened?

1240
01:26:42,814 --> 01:26:43,815
I talk to you,

1241
01:26:43,848 --> 01:26:45,782
next thing I know
you're taking people hostage.

1242
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:48,748
They killed three passengers,
including a fed.

1243
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,681
They derailed the train.

1244
01:26:50,715 --> 01:26:52,948
-All to get some evidence.
-Okay.

1245
01:26:54,146 --> 01:26:55,281
So where is it, Mike?

1246
01:26:55,313 --> 01:26:56,913
Not until Karen
and Danny are safe.

1247
01:26:56,946 --> 01:26:59,047
Local PD's
calling me directly.

1248
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:00,415
So, we wait.

1249
01:27:03,213 --> 01:27:04,914
We wait.

1250
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,347
Yeah.

1251
01:27:10,313 --> 01:27:11,714
How you guys doing?

1252
01:27:11,747 --> 01:27:12,881
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Not too bad.

1253
01:27:12,914 --> 01:27:15,648
-Perfect.
-Fine, but I gotta pee.

1254
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:19,980
Mike, I know
this isn't you, man.

1255
01:27:20,014 --> 01:27:25,081
Look, you say they set you up,
you got a witness, evidence.

1256
01:27:25,113 --> 01:27:27,413
-I believe you, but...
-But what?

1257
01:27:27,446 --> 01:27:29,148
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

1258
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,714
It's what I can prove.

1259
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,947
Look, you want confirmation
on your family. I understand.

1260
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:35,079
But from where I sit,

1261
01:27:35,112 --> 01:27:36,413
I say we end
this thing right now.

1262
01:27:36,446 --> 01:27:39,280
Just give me what you got,
nobody else has to get hurt.

1263
01:27:39,313 --> 01:27:43,747
You telling me that
as a detective or a friend?

1264
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:45,847
I don't know, Mike.
What would you tell me?

1265
01:27:48,913 --> 01:27:50,980
We're running
out of time, man.

1266
01:27:53,013 --> 01:27:55,980
Mike, I get it. You wanna
do the noble thing here.

1267
01:27:56,013 --> 01:27:56,880
But I got news for you.

1268
01:27:56,912 --> 01:27:58,179
There ain't
no such thing as noble.

1269
01:28:07,979 --> 01:28:09,946
-It was you.
-What are you talking about?

1270
01:28:09,978 --> 01:28:12,779
You called me. You knew
about the witness. You...

1271
01:28:14,313 --> 01:28:15,746
You knew what they saw.

1272
01:28:15,779 --> 01:28:17,846
Yeah, I told you
what happened.

1273
01:28:17,878 --> 01:28:19,313
It was a cop who killed him.

1274
01:28:20,846 --> 01:28:23,345
-You set me up.
-Hey, slow down, Mike.

1275
01:28:23,379 --> 01:28:26,113
You killed Enrique Mendez.

1276
01:28:26,145 --> 01:28:27,945
You knew Prynne was
getting on this train.

1277
01:28:27,978 --> 01:28:30,012
-You targeted me.
-Mike...

1278
01:28:30,046 --> 01:28:33,780
An ex-cop rides this
train every day. You knew.

1279
01:28:33,812 --> 01:28:35,179
Mike, whoever's talking to you,
they're trying to get in your...

1280
01:28:35,211 --> 01:28:38,712
-Son of a...
-You've lost it, man.

1281
01:28:38,745 --> 01:28:40,746
Talk, God damn it. Talk!

1282
01:28:40,778 --> 01:28:42,011
<i>Friendly's
engaged with the target.</i>

1283
01:28:42,044 --> 01:28:44,145
I repeat, friendly's
engaged with the target.

1284
01:28:44,179 --> 01:28:46,746
Do not fire
until you get a clear shot.

1285
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:48,378
And say what?

1286
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:51,079
That you killed
three people, a fed?

1287
01:28:51,111 --> 01:28:53,312
You derailed a train and took
the passengers hostage,

1288
01:28:53,345 --> 01:28:56,346
all 'cause some mystery woman
threatened your family?

1289
01:28:56,378 --> 01:28:57,911
You did this.

1290
01:28:57,944 --> 01:28:59,779
Doesn't look
that way, does it?

1291
01:28:59,811 --> 01:29:02,111
So why don't you
put down the gun

1292
01:29:02,144 --> 01:29:04,078
before someone
you love gets hurt?

1293
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:06,745
Where are they?
Where's my family?

1294
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,978
I will kill you, Murph.
I swear to God.

1295
01:29:12,012 --> 01:29:15,179
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm trying to help you here.

1296
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:17,078
A lot of powerful people
have got a lot to lose

1297
01:29:17,111 --> 01:29:18,412
if that evidence gets out.

1298
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:21,345
They have eyes everywhere,
even inside the Bureau.

1299
01:29:21,378 --> 01:29:23,245
I told them to put the
witness on your train.

1300
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:24,412
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

1301
01:29:24,444 --> 01:29:25,579
You needed the money.

1302
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:28,411
But you couldn't just do
what she asked, could you?

1303
01:29:33,812 --> 01:29:36,846
If I don't answer that,
your family dies.

1304
01:29:39,143 --> 01:29:40,678
So why don't you
give me the gun?

1305
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:43,846
You got no choice, Mike.

1306
01:29:46,478 --> 01:29:48,145
It doesn't have to
end this way.

1307
01:29:49,811 --> 01:29:52,110
Come on. Karen, Danny...

1308
01:29:52,143 --> 01:29:53,811
Don't you dare
say their names.

1309
01:29:57,143 --> 01:29:59,178
You've done enough, Mike.

1310
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,677
<i>-Is it done?
-We're good.</i>

1311
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:10,711
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1312
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:20,111
See, the thing is, Mike...
I got a family, too, you know.

1313
01:30:20,144 --> 01:30:21,944
All right, who's Prynne?

1314
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:26,010
Murph, listen to me.

1315
01:30:26,044 --> 01:30:27,277
All I gotta do
is call her back, Mike.

1316
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:34,045
Come on.

1317
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:40,112
All right, who's Prynne?

1318
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:44,911
Who's Prynne?

1319
01:30:47,476 --> 01:30:50,077
Mike, who's Prynne?

1320
01:30:53,776 --> 01:30:55,276
Who's Prynne?

1321
01:30:59,342 --> 01:31:01,644
It's me.

1322
01:31:07,209 --> 01:31:08,844
I'm Prynne.

1323
01:31:12,743 --> 01:31:15,044
No, man.
She's covering for me.

1324
01:31:17,077 --> 01:31:19,310
-I am Prynne.
-Wait.

1325
01:31:22,742 --> 01:31:25,742
I'm the witness. I'm Prynne.

1326
01:31:25,775 --> 01:31:28,309
No. I'm Prynne.

1327
01:31:28,343 --> 01:31:30,877
They're lying. I'm Prynne,

1328
01:31:30,909 --> 01:31:32,643
and I know what you did,
you bastard.

1329
01:31:34,342 --> 01:31:36,777
I am not Prynne, so...

1330
01:31:39,743 --> 01:31:41,810
-No one is.
-It's gotta be someone.

1331
01:31:46,476 --> 01:31:48,342
-You get a shot, take him out.
-Roger.

1332
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:03,043
Leave it.

1333
01:32:44,842 --> 01:32:46,242
Murph.

1334
01:32:51,174 --> 01:32:55,174
Overwatch, do you have a shot?
Repeat, do you have a shot?

1335
01:32:56,141 --> 01:32:57,208
<i>Negative.</i>

1336
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,940
Watch the hostages.

1337
01:32:58,974 --> 01:33:00,408
<i>-Watch the friendly.
-Holding fire.</i>

1338
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:02,142
What are you gonna do,
kill all of us?

1339
01:33:02,175 --> 01:33:03,875
No, you are.

1340
01:33:05,908 --> 01:33:07,042
<i>Target is clear.</i>

1341
01:33:08,241 --> 01:33:09,675
Take him out.

1342
01:33:21,773 --> 01:33:23,409
-No gun.
-Get down!

1343
01:33:23,441 --> 01:33:26,341
Do not move!
Stay down!

1344
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:27,741
-Do not move!
-Against the wall!

1345
01:33:27,774 --> 01:33:29,908
Get down! Get down!

1346
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:35,674
-All the way down!
-Stop! Stop! Stop!

1347
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:36,741
He saved me!

1348
01:33:37,807 --> 01:33:40,174
-He saved me.
-Prynne?

1349
01:33:51,841 --> 01:33:54,975
MacCauley? Michael MacCauley?

1350
01:33:55,007 --> 01:33:56,741
Yeah.

1351
01:33:56,773 --> 01:34:00,273
I'm Agent Garcia, FBI.
Your family's safe.

1352
01:34:00,306 --> 01:34:02,741
We arrested three men
outside your home.

1353
01:34:18,107 --> 01:34:20,407
He was your cousin?

1354
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:22,873
Tell me what you saw.

1355
01:34:23,973 --> 01:34:25,807
-Thanks.
-Okay.

1356
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,840
This way.
Watch your step.

1357
01:34:31,739 --> 01:34:33,040
So this is
the end of the line.

1358
01:34:33,074 --> 01:34:34,673
I guess so.

1359
01:34:34,707 --> 01:34:37,773
Next time
I'm taking the bus.

1360
01:34:37,807 --> 01:34:40,407
All I know is this, all right?
That guy is a goddamn hero.

1361
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:42,940
-Okay? A hero. Write that down.
-Yeah.

1362
01:34:42,972 --> 01:34:44,272
H-E-R-O. Hero.

1363
01:34:45,206 --> 01:34:47,373
A hero. Did you write it?

1364
01:34:47,405 --> 01:34:49,739
-"Hero."
-Thank you.

1365
01:34:54,473 --> 01:34:56,674
So, what's up?
You got a boyfriend or what?

1366
01:34:56,707 --> 01:34:59,072
What?

1367
01:34:59,106 --> 01:35:01,240
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Is it serious?

1368
01:35:01,273 --> 01:35:03,340
I wanna know what I'm dealing
with, you know what I mean?

1369
01:35:03,372 --> 01:35:06,239
-Hi, darling.
-Hey, babe.

1370
01:35:06,273 --> 01:35:08,240
My God. Look at
you. Are you okay?

1371
01:35:08,272 --> 01:35:11,372
-I'm all right. Hey, big guy.
-Hey, Dad.

1372
01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:12,772
How you doing?

1373
01:35:13,806 --> 01:35:15,340
Mrs. MacCauley,

1374
01:35:15,372 --> 01:35:18,306
I believe
you may have lost this.

1375
01:35:19,738 --> 01:35:21,339
I've been looking
for this all day.

1376
01:35:21,372 --> 01:35:24,938
-Shall we get you home?
-Yeah, let's go home.

1377
01:35:24,972 --> 01:35:26,705
So, this is
what you do every day

1378
01:35:26,739 --> 01:35:27,972
when you go to work?

1379
01:35:28,006 --> 01:35:30,372
Yeah, every day.

1380
01:35:30,406 --> 01:35:32,407
Come on, help me up.

1381
01:35:35,373 --> 01:35:37,773
I can't believe
what they're saying.

1382
01:35:37,805 --> 01:35:40,338
Is it really true about Murph?

1383
01:35:42,438 --> 01:35:45,639
Give me a second, will you?
Give me a second.

1384
01:35:51,237 --> 01:35:52,504
David.

1385
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:55,939
I have to tell you, there's
been an ongoing investigation

1386
01:35:55,971 --> 01:35:58,806
into Alex Murphy
and others in the department.

1387
01:35:58,838 --> 01:36:01,839
-There was a woman.
-Female, mid-30s.

1388
01:36:02,471 --> 01:36:03,872
We're checking CCTV

1389
01:36:03,905 --> 01:36:05,673
in and around
86th Street, right?

1390
01:36:05,705 --> 01:36:08,972
-Yeah.
-When we know, you'll know.

1391
01:36:11,471 --> 01:36:14,838
What can I say?
I'm sorry it got this far.

1392
01:36:18,338 --> 01:36:21,105
Listen, Mike...

1393
01:36:21,137 --> 01:36:24,271
We miss guys like you
in the department.

1394

the derailment,</i>

1407
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:00,271
<i>does she even exist?</i>

1408
01:37:12,236 --> 01:37:13,404
"What makes a man

1409
01:37:13,438 --> 01:37:16,103
"is what he does
when the storm comes."

1410
01:37:16,137 --> 01:37:18,137
Alexandre Dumas.

1411
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:24,170
Read that one
a few years back.

1412
01:37:24,204 --> 01:37:25,405
It's got a hell of an ending.

1413
01:37:25,437 --> 01:37:27,771
This seat taken?

1414
01:37:27,804 --> 01:37:31,704
-The 6:20 every morning
to Chicago. -30 home.

1415
01:37:31,737 --> 01:37:35,071
You know, I never took you
for a commuter.

1416
01:37:35,104 --> 01:37:36,804
I'm sorry. Have we met?

1417
01:37:36,836 --> 01:37:39,671
The way I figure it,
the people you work for,

1418
01:37:39,703 --> 01:37:43,270
Alex Murphy goes down,
you win.

1419
01:37:43,303 --> 01:37:47,038
That 16-year-old girl
dies on that train, you win.

1420
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:49,804
You do your job, disappear,

1421
01:37:49,836 --> 01:37:52,637
the rest of us
just collateral damage.

1422
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:57,871
You didn't pick me because
the witness was on my train.

1423
01:37:57,903 --> 01:38:00,336
You put her on the train.

1424
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:04,237
Maybe you even got me fired.

1425
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:06,270
Suddenly I have motive,
opportunity,

1426
01:38:06,302 --> 01:38:08,269
just like Alex Murphy.

1427
01:38:08,303 --> 01:38:12,104
This wasn't his operation.
You played us both.

1428
01:38:17,469 --> 01:38:20,638
I'm not sure what you think
is gonna happen here, Michael.

1429
01:38:21,737 --> 01:38:24,170
One little thing.

1430
01:38:24,202 --> 01:38:25,704
And what's that?

1431
01:38:25,705 --> 01:38:29,705
Subrip: Pix

1432
