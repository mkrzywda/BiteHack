00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:40,574
For the last time,

5
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:44,829
release Abdel Salman Al-Arkan
from his prison in Paris.

6
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:49,949
This is Lucas Graves, IDP News,
signing off.

7
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:53,575
Please. They're gonna kill us all!

8
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:04,733
Release him, or the execution plays live
in 45 minutes.

9
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:12,342
They're gonna kill us.

10
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:16,875
Stay strong.

11
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:23,888
Destination confirmed.

12
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:27,185
<i>You should kill them.</i>

13
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,292
<i>A powerful statement, a
Westerner killing his own people.</i>

14
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,732
Recalculating route.

15
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:49,440
<i>They should have called.</i>

16
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,787
<i>They should have called already!</i>

17
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,637
No. No. No, please!

18
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:26,253
Please don't kill me!

19
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:10,063
Go. Go!

20
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,523
Come on. Move. Go!

21
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:18,864
<i>They're getting away! Let's go! Let's go!</i>

22
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:27,673
Go.

23
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,999
<i>I'll take the north side.</i>

24
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:48,392
<i>OK!</i>

25
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:29,876
<i>Keep searching the southside.</i>

26
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:31,544
<i>Lock down the perimeter.</i>

27
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,088
Shit. He's not here.

28
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:03,771
Get them on the truck now.

29
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:08,013
Let's go! Let's go!

30
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:16,954
Kimbral's not here. He's got the keys.

31
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:26,491
Come on!

32
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:32,530
What the fuck was that?

33
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,766
We got to go, Shu.

34
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:36,139
Come on, come on, come on.

35
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,176
Where the hell's Kimbral?

36
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,684
You are 40 seconds late, Kimbral.

37
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,192
Go, go!

38
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:53,993
Where the hell were you?

39
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,140
- She's been shot.
- Give me room. Give me room!

40
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:16,406
Alice. Alice!

41
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:19,210
Come on.

42
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:23,223
Damn it.

43
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,730
Abby!

44
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,663
Move, move, move, move, move.
What happened?

45
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:35,329
She's shot in the chest.

46
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:37,868
What the hell took you guys so long?

47
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:40,001
Shit. Fuck.

48
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:42,108
Okay.

49
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:45,779
Oh, God.

50
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:51,579
She's gone.

51
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:53,086
Shit.

52
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:55,379
This is on you.

53
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:58,516
What the hell happened?

54
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:04,397
Goddamn it.

55
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:12,803
What happened?

56
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:22,545
I had a chance to blow their weapons load,
and I took it.

57
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:25,278
- It wasn't part of the fucking plan!
- I factored it in.

58
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:27,278
- Oh, you factored it in?
- The route I took, the speed...

59
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:30,553
- Where were you?
- Did you use your computer program?

60
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:33,992
Shu, there was less than point zero zero...

61
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,726
Shu, the algorithm was solid.

62
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,103
You lost a hostage?

63
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,406
Bossman's gonna be pissed.

64
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:58,347
Get us the fuck out of here, Hush.

65
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:32,147
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Come on in and sit down.

66
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:41,888
I'm letting you go.

67
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,720
- What?
- I'm letting you go.

68
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,824
I won't be needing your services anymore.

69
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:52,630
You know,
the most important thing in this job

70
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:54,469
is knowing you can trust the guy
next to you.

71
00:09:56,176 --> 00:10:00,044
I told you before.
This program of yours, it wasn't ready,

72
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:01,978
and you defied the team.

73
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,210
My program's not ready,
or you just don't like it?

74
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:06,085
A woman died.

75
00:10:06,153 --> 00:10:09,145
Could've happened without the algorithm.
Don't you put that on me.

76
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:11,748
You want to make all these excuses up
in your head: Algorithm.

77
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,690
Whatever it is, someone died

78
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:16,662
because you trusted a computer
more than your own team.

79
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,730
You got to go.

80
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:33,941
Told you we expanded too fast.

81
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,329
You gonna sit there and bust my balls
or get back to work?

82
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,519
Next time, I'll listen to you... maybe.

83
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:50,128
How do you say, quote, "I am stupid"?

84
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:54,190
<i>I'm stupid...</i>

85
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,429
Why do you want to learn Qingdao?

86
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:00,703
It's almost impossible
for a Western ear to decipher.

87
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:01,774
I like the impossible.

88
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:06,412
This game, Go, is interesting.

89
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:08,406
Why do you think you win all the time?

90
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,813
Because I've been playing Go
since I was four,

91
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,884
and you started two years ago.

92
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:17,146
You move everything together.

93
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:20,086
You take the territory as one.

94
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,256
You take my pieces as one.
Everything flows as one.

95
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:28,626
When you were at the factory,
none of your guys moved together.

96
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:30,328
You didn't flow as one.

97
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,234
Kimbral was trying to upstage you.

98
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:35,402
Maybe I should work alone.

99
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:38,438
No one does it alone.

100
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:43,349
I guess that's why I hear your voice
in my head when I am on the job.

101
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:47,317
It may sound like me,
but I think that voice is your intuition.

102
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:50,782
Take all the time you need,

103
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:54,259
but when you come back,
I need you to be a team player.

104
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:58,757
Don't be like Kimbral.

105
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,864
Don't confuse intuition with ego.

106
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,102
Trust me on this one, Shu.
Always listen to your intuition.

107
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:08,865
Always.

108
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:25,857
The original communication satellite

109
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,860
set out to solve one problem...

110
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:33,993
how to send a signal successfully
around the bend in the Earth

111
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:36,128
and reach the receiver.

112
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:40,230
Today, we at Yusheng Technology
are proud to present to you

113
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,535
the future of satellite tech.

114
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:44,975
We do it faster, with smaller units...

115
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,536
Now this is where the graphics
are gonna change?

116
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,208
<i>I don't need graphics!</i>

117
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,251
<i>This isn't Cirque de Soleil.</i>

118
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:55,219
<i>Maybe a tiger can jump out when
I get to the cubesats.</i>

119
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:56,515
Chin!

120
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,716
<i>A little help here please.</i>

121
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:00,989
What? I like tigers.

122
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,055
Okay, everyone,
let's reset and go again in five.

123
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,259
- Yusheng?
- Huh?

124
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:13,899
Don't worry, little bro. You'll be great.

125
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:17,076
Thank you.

126
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,517
I didn't expect to see you here.

127
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:36,596
Your job keeps you busier than I am.

128
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,891
Who knew being a security specialist
was so time-consuming?

129
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:42,868
I have a job next week in Macao.

130
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:44,460
So you were in the neighborhood.

131
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,645
It's great to see you, Chin.

132
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:56,238
I wish I could say
the same thing about your brother.

133
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,284
What can I help you with?

134
00:13:58,785 --> 00:14:00,252
Yusheng is in trouble.

135
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:03,254
Genius or not, he's careless.

136
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:05,553
- Lot of people want to see him die.
- Who?

137
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:08,754
A company called Ruscho
is who I'm most worried about.

138
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,990
They're a tech giant
headquartered in Geneva,

139
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:14,727
and they tried to buy Yusheng out
three times already, and he's refused.

140
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:18,304
These are not the kind of guys
who take no for an answer.

141
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,603
He's going to Bangkok this weekend
for a bachelor party,

142
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:23,900
and he won't take a bodyguard.

143
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:29,506
I'll pay you.

144
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:37,951
We are family. Not necessary.

145
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,679
<i>Party's over. Let's go. It's not safe here.</i>

146
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:01,941
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

147
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:03,676
<i>OK, cousin.</i>

148
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:05,208
<i>I'm taking you home.</i>

149
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:35,271
I am Galileo. You are inmate 1764.

150
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:39,271
I repeat, you are inmate 1764.

151
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,441
Welcome to Hades.

152
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:17,449
Attention, inmate 1764.

153
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:19,417
You have been reported to battle
in the zoo.

154
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:28,352
Begin battle.

155
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:03,125
The battle is over.

156
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:09,197
Inmate 1764, you have earned
two hours of sanctuary time.

157
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:13,195
All remaining inmates
return to your spoke.

158
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:14,466
You okay?

159
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:17,236
All prisoners return to your spoke.

160
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:29,145
There must be someone we could talk to...

161
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,250
to get us out of here.
I didn't do anything wrong.

162
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,725
I didn't do anything wrong.

163
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:49,572
Inmate 1764, report to the sanctuary.

164
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:53,576
What is this?

165
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:56,747
Must be where the winners go.

166
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,790
Shu's gone. This is legit.
What do you got?

167
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,160
His cousin says she's been
trying them both for 18 hours. No luck.

168
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:45,925
- Party happened Saturday night.
- What'd you get from the party?

169
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,591
No security tapes, nothing.

170
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,895
All right, I'll look into it.

171
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:53,796
All prisoners return to your spoke.

172
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:57,235
All prisoners return to your spoke.

173
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,825
The first thing they try to do in lockup
is break your spirit.

174
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:28,332
Can't allow that to happen.
You have to stay mentally strong.

175
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:34,613
You have to focus on three key things
to a successful breakout.

176
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:35,875
What are they?

177
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:38,851
One, know the layout.

178
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,711
Two, understand the routine.

179
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:47,623
Three, have help from the inside or out.

180
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:50,959
Teamwork. Exactly.
Your favorite one, I can tell.

181
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:56,364
Remember, Shu, you move together.
Everything flows as one.

182
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:37,835
One, seven, six, four.

183
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:45,838
Are you the warden?

184
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:49,104
Your cousin is a brilliant man.

185
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:54,950
He gave me the details of his patent,
number 34ACJL.

186
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:59,728
But not number 36BBBCK.

187
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,929
I need you to convince him
to give that to me.

188
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:07,739
Why would I do that?

189
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,241
You grew up together.

190
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:12,819
Like brothers.

191
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:14,640
But you weren't brothers.

192
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,714
A family tragedy forced you
to live with him.

193
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,650
You hated Yusheng.

194
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:22,454
How he was always smarter
than everyone else.

195
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:25,888
He could've helped a lot of people,
but he went for himself instead,

196
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:26,983
and he got rich.

197
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,651
And now, his love of money...

198
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,246
his precious patent...

199
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,007
is going to get you killed.

200
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:41,670
I know everything about my animals.

201
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,695
You want to know who I am?

202
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,660
I'm the zookeeper.

203
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:52,678
All prisoners report to the zoo.

204
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:56,421
- All prisoners report to the zoo.
- What did you tell him?

205
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:58,357
What?

206
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:00,692
You gave up the first patent.

207
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:03,456
So? They were torturing me.
That one's nothing.

208
00:23:04,097 --> 00:23:07,328
- He knew things about our background.
- I didn't tell him.

209
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:13,769
The second patent, what is it?

210
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:20,673
Advanced cube satellite tech.
It's a game changer.

211
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,113
It can override and control
any computer system in the world.

212
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:27,119
Like a cyber skeleton key.
And it's not what you think.

213
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:30,486
This isn't about money.
I patented it so I could bury it.

214
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:32,548
In the wrong hands, game over.

215
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:35,992
Defense systems, nuclear codes.
No one will be safe.

216
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:49,374
Kimbral.

217
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,819
No, no. Not every day is a fight day.

218
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:07,383
What are we doing here?

219
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:10,923
I'm his cousin.

220
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:16,093
I don't think it's a coincidence
that we both are here.

221
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:18,393
I think they're after Breslin.

222
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:20,096
You know, after spending
a lot of time with this,

223
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:21,164
I put my ear to the ground,

224
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:23,404
I just didn't like what I saw,
didn't like what I heard.

225
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,909
How long have you been here?

226
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:26,570
It's hard to say.

227
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:30,376
My best guess is... couple of months.

228
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:32,948
What is this place?

229
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:34,883
There's a lot of rumors, like mythology.

230
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:36,714
It's called
the High Asset Detention Service.

231
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:38,223
Hades.

232
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:39,950
Greek mythology?

233
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,052
Land of the dead.

234
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:44,254
Whoever goes in just doesn't come out.
It's that simple.

235
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:46,232
- Sounds familiar.
- Yeah.

236
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:50,201
The word is the people behind the Tomb
took a beating, did some adjustments,

237
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,390
- and then came back strong.
- Who are these assholes?

238
00:24:52,972 --> 00:24:56,931
Spies, criminals,
businessmen, elected officials.

239
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:58,043
Profit. Big profit.

240
00:24:58,478 --> 00:24:59,602
What makes you think he's there?

241
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:04,709
His cousin Yusheng was put on
some kind of hit list by his competition,

242
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,483
a satellite tech company called Ruscho.

243
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:10,078
There's battle days
and there's truce days.

244
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,290
If you win a battle, you get benefits.

245
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,859
If you lose or refuse to fight...

246
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:18,062
your time in here is very uncomfortable.

247
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:21,795
That's why they call it "the zoo."
We're all animals here.

248
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,163
Survival of the fittest.

249
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:26,796
If you want someone to disappear so bad,
why not just kill them?

250
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:29,272
Because then the world
will know they are dead.

251
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:32,997
Here, they are just gone.

252
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,014
Then we got to go in, get them out.

253
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:37,841
Can't go in there blind.
We don't know a layout.

254
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:40,285
- We don't have anything.
- You broke the Tomb totally blind.

255
00:25:40,353 --> 00:25:41,353
Yeah, well, I got lucky.

256
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:43,134
We don't even know for sure
if Shu's there.

257
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:45,281
- And what if he is?
- Look, if he's there, we'll get him.

258
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,418
We go in there blind,
we get trapped ourselves.

259
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:49,459
You don't think I can handle it.

260
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:51,997
This is bigger than any one of us.

261
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:55,133
All right.

262
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:11,139
Sir, we've got a data breach.
Someone's in our system.

263
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:14,209
What? Shut it down. Shut it down now.

264
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,225
- Uh-huh.
- Just cleaning up for the night.

265
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:30,335
Uh-huh.

266
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,469
Here's the only contact I got at Ruscho.

267
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,280
Not sure if he'll talk to you,
but it's a good place to start.

268
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,034
A sticky note?

269
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:47,845
- So what do you got?
- All right.

270
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:51,163
Two things. A dark bank account,
code-named Sparrow,

271
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,822
Ruscho's been sending money to.

272
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:55,256
And they also sent ten million
to Leon Grassi,

273
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,261
a lobbyist
for the private prison industry.

274
00:26:58,097 --> 00:26:59,689
I know this Leon Grassi.

275
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:03,694
He used to work for the prison board
for about 13 years,

276
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,261
and then he started taking a lot of heat

277
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:07,171
every time I broke out
of one of his places,

278
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,107
so he decided to jump into
the private sector.

279
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,369
Haven't heard from him since.

280
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:13,275
You look very nice today,
but you know that.

281
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,954
Get you a drink?

282
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:38,130
Not what you got, Tiny.

283
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:41,137
I know you didn't go straight
and get an honest job pouring drinks,

284
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,368
so tell me, DeRosa,
what are you doing here?

285
00:27:44,444 --> 00:27:46,036
Could easily ask you the same question.

286
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:47,579
Yeah, well, that's personal.

287
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:53,264
Got a call from Abigail,
this being the first time

288
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,288
you're back in the field
after being a desk jockey for so long.

289
00:27:57,865 --> 00:27:59,526
She thought you might be a little rusty.

290
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,502
Oh, that hurts.

291
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:05,121
He's here.

292
00:28:06,332 --> 00:28:09,597
- Know that guy as well?
- You mean the wannabe gangster? No.

293
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:10,795
You recognize him?

294
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:13,667
Want me to introduce you?

295
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:17,071
Since when are you so tight with Abigail?

296
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:19,509
Like you said, it's personal.

297
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,638
How you doing, Leon?

298
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:23,782
Leon.

299
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:26,943
You know, one of my men is missing,

300
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,989
and I think he's in
a black-site prison called Hades.

301
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:31,420
Ring a bell anywhere?

302
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:36,186
And there's this company called Ruscho.
European satellite tech company.

303
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:40,095
They gave you about ten million bucks.
How about that?

304
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,531
Ten million dollars.

305
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:44,359
Lot of money.
But I think it's all bullshit.

306
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:46,805
Because you don't lobby
for satellite tech.

307
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:47,703
Look, Ray...

308
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:50,469
You lobby for black-site prison profit,
am I right?

309
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:53,376
- Look, Ray...
- You're gonna tell me what you know.

310
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,367
Move!

311
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:26,307
Hey, Breslin...

312
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,408
Good to be back?

313
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:31,978
No, it's bad to be back.

314
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:37,515
- Leon, who you working for?
- I'm sorry, Ray. I can't...

315
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:45,357
Come on. Want a job, DeRosa?

316
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:47,332
Fuck, yeah.

317
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,597
There's this private bank account,
and I need it identified.

318
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:53,228
With him dead, it's our only lead.

319
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:56,503
All right.
Give me a day, I'll figure it out.

320
00:30:31,944 --> 00:30:32,944
Hey.

321
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:36,039
Where are you coming from?

322
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:39,035
I work for the prison. I'm the cook.

323
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:41,638
Tell me about the kitchen.

324
00:30:43,422 --> 00:30:44,422
What do you mean?

325
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,390
How do I get there from your cell?

326
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:48,627
I got to go.

327
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:57,426
Yes.

328
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:06,408
You are on the wrong side
of the zoo, my friend.

329
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:09,107
- I need you to kick my ass.
- What? It's a truce day.

330
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:27,499
Come on.

331
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:37,600
What the hell are you up to?

332
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:42,500
Thought I could work the doctor,
get us some benefits.

333
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:46,740
Turns out the doctor is a lamp stand.

334
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:50,181
My name is Akala.

335
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:51,249
Shu.

336
00:33:02,595 --> 00:33:04,529
- What?
- He connected the dots.

337
00:33:04,597 --> 00:33:06,758
Your inside man at Ruscho
sent me down a rabbit hole.

338
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:12,528
But it looks like I found a guy
who can lead us to Shu.

339
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:13,765
Where is this guy?

340
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:16,700
Right now? Driving the car I'm chasing.

341
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:20,234
Sure hope you know what you're doing.

342
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:22,107
Call you back.

343
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,014
Where you hiding?

344
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,310
Damn it!

345
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:31,476
Fuck me.

346
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:37,513
Inmates 1764 and 1765, report to the zoo.

347
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:39,853
I repeat, report to the zoo.

348
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:43,894
They tortured me again last night.

349
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:54,063
You were always
mentally tougher than me as a kid.

350
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:55,401
Remember?

351
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,400
You need to be now.

352
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,251
Begin battle.

353
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:55,393
Battle is over.

354
00:35:55,468 --> 00:36:01,236
Inmates 1764, 1765, you've earned
two hours of sanctuary time.

355
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:06,241
Negative skeleton theory.

356
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:10,404
Use what they let you see
to map out what you can't see.

357
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:15,446
That's how the layout begins
to reveal itself to you.

358
00:36:23,162 --> 00:36:27,258
Train your mind to look beyond
the physical wall that confines you.

359
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,746
There's a whole separate world
on the other side of the cells.

360
00:36:42,615 --> 00:36:47,484
Hallways, interrogation,
infirmary, kitchen, HQ.

361
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,116
Right now, it's all negative space.

362
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,083
But not for long.

363
00:36:56,962 --> 00:36:58,623
I'm gonna get us out of here.

364
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:08,633
Fuck.

365
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:10,470
Come on, Luke. Where are you?

366
00:37:11,377 --> 00:37:13,811
This is the last number
Luke called on his cell.

367
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:18,776
Ruscho Geneva?

368
00:37:19,718 --> 00:37:21,208
Should I get Hush in here?

369
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,782
No.

370
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:29,460
You know, someone once told me...

371
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:33,557
the single most important thing
to remember

372
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:36,066
in solving the hardest riddles

373
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:38,155
is that they're designed to trick you.

374
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:40,495
Subvert against your own assumptions.

375
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:45,172
And my assumptions are telling me
that there's no way

376
00:37:45,244 --> 00:37:47,974
that you would let Luke
go directly against company order.

377
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:51,238
Look, he just wanted to do the legwork.

378
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,990
Thought it was a good chance for him
to take the lead on something.

379
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:56,016
And now Luke and Shu are missing.

380
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:07,227
You are prisoner 1924.
I repeat, you are prisoner 1924.

381
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,698
Welcome to Hades.

382
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:25,443
Sir, I felt something was going on.
I hacked into the system,

383
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,951
and basically, Luke tried to meet up
with Ruscho Geneva.

384
00:38:29,054 --> 00:38:30,054
Are you serious?

385
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:33,002
I told him to stay away from these guys.
How'd he get involved with that?

386
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,688
It was me. I gave him one of my contacts.

387
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:42,533
Come on.

388
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,242
After you went missing,
Breslin started digging.

389
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:57,282
He thinks this place was started
by the same people behind the Tomb,

390
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,750
so I...

391
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:04,416
I screwed up. Ended up in here.

392
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,051
Doesn't matter.
I'm close to getting the layout.

393
00:39:09,662 --> 00:39:11,994
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing yet.

394
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:15,089
The less contact we have, the better.

395
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:19,629
Shu, it can't be a coincidence

396
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:22,673
that all three of Breslin's specialists
are locked up here now.

397
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,174
No, it can't.

398
00:39:25,177 --> 00:39:26,667
Assume they are watching us.

399
00:39:43,962 --> 00:39:45,122
Please.

400
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,022
He's close to giving it to you.

401
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,794
Close?

402
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:51,696
He won't last.

403
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:53,704
Then he needs to give me what I want.

404
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:57,038
Or I'll feed him
to the rest of the animals.

405
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:13,481
I've tried to make soup dumplings
since I was a kid,

406
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:16,790
but every time, the dough is too stiff.

407
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:22,634
Look, I don't know what your deal is,

408
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:26,304
but... I don't want to die.

409
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:28,362
What they are doing to you is wrong.

410
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:33,568
Then let me help you get home.

411
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:40,750
They blindfold me
when I go from my cell to the kitchen.

412
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:45,180
That's not the only way to see.

413
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:51,254
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19, 20...

414
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:52,994
How many steps?

415
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:54,858
Twenty-four.

416
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,062
The one gift
every prison gives you is time.

417
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,535
Don't waste it.

418
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:01,937
Visualize the layout
every chance you have.

419
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:07,543
It was 45 this morning.

420
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:09,541
What?

421
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:11,173
Steps to the kitchen.

422
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,581
The distance doubled?

423
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:18,189
Come on!

424
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:31,626
I need to get in the sanctuary.

425
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:33,398
Yeah, and I need a Coke.

426
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:34,632
Sweet dreams.

427
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:49,479
All prisoners return to your spoke.

428
00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:54,122
I repeat,
all prisoners return to your spoke.

429
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:46,834
Even the most complex of narratives
are often based on one simple idea.

430
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,473
The answer is most likely
right in front of you.

431
00:42:57,456 --> 00:42:58,684
The prison is moving.

432
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:02,724
The cell spokes
change entry points to the zoo.

433
00:43:02,828 --> 00:43:03,954
Like a Rubik's Cube?

434
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:08,122
We got no routine. We got no layout.

435
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:10,157
And we have no help.

436
00:43:10,836 --> 00:43:11,962
Maybe we do.

437
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,236
Neo-Nazis?

438
00:43:18,343 --> 00:43:21,312
Computer nerds.
They brought them in some time back.

439
00:43:22,314 --> 00:43:25,010
They rounded them up
in some random basement in Iceland.

440
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,575
The call themselves The Legion.

441
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:31,155
The leader's handle is Count Zero.

442
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:34,655
He's screwed with
more Fortune 500 companies

443
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:36,216
than you and I can name.

444
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:38,023
But our zookeeper's got a problem

445
00:43:38,096 --> 00:43:40,394
'cause he doesn't know
which one is actually Count Zero.

446
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:43,194
He's interrogated them day and night.

447
00:43:44,202 --> 00:43:46,670
No sanctuary time ever.

448
00:43:47,406 --> 00:43:49,101
Why does the prison care?

449
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:53,700
Because Count Zero
has acquired the specs to the prison.

450
00:43:54,513 --> 00:43:57,778
They need to know who he is
and where his servers are.

451
00:43:57,883 --> 00:43:59,544
- Specs of the prison?
- Yes.

452
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:02,953
If you can find out which one
is Count Zero before the prison...

453
00:44:04,122 --> 00:44:05,521
maybe he can help us.

454
00:44:34,419 --> 00:44:35,579
I need to see Bug.

455
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:47,627
I need to see... Bug.

456
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:50,327
If you want a book on insects,
they're upstairs.

457
00:44:57,342 --> 00:44:59,173
Okay. Right this way.

458
00:45:37,783 --> 00:45:38,783
Bug.

459
00:45:44,656 --> 00:45:45,656
DeRosa?

460
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:48,526
Sparrow.

461
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:53,025
- Who is he?
- Come on. I can't give that to you.

462
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:55,065
The Insect Society

463
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,465
- clients remain anonymous.
- Clients remain anonymous.

464
00:45:57,536 --> 00:45:59,026
- Above all else...
- Shut up, Bug.

465
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:05,510
We've been boys for a long time.

466
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:11,147
I love what you guys do here.

467
00:46:13,018 --> 00:46:14,018
Now, Bug...

468
00:46:19,357 --> 00:46:21,049
But I'm gonna have to
kick the shit out of you

469
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:22,526
if you don't start talking to me.

470
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:24,661
I'll get you a name.

471
00:46:24,729 --> 00:46:25,821
Thank you.

472
00:46:27,866 --> 00:46:29,426
I'm gonna need one more thing from you.

473
00:46:58,864 --> 00:47:00,195
Yusheng's close.

474
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:02,123
Time is up.

475
00:47:02,234 --> 00:47:04,964
You're asking him to give up
his life's work.

476
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,197
We both know that
that's not what this is about.

477
00:47:07,272 --> 00:47:09,433
You know exactly what that tech can do.

478
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:11,474
Time is up!

479
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:15,269
No!

480
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:28,990
Battle is over.

481
00:47:29,094 --> 00:47:34,225
Inmates 1789, 3486, 6412,

482
00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:36,233
you've earned two hours of sanctuary time.

483
00:47:50,148 --> 00:47:51,615
I need your help.

484
00:47:56,354 --> 00:47:59,187
One of you knows the layout of this place.

485
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:06,591
Wait. The sanctuary.

486
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,123
Have you ever been in?

487
00:48:14,506 --> 00:48:17,134
Give me that layout, I can get you in.

488
00:48:21,947 --> 00:48:23,005
We are Legion.

489
00:49:06,224 --> 00:49:07,589
We are Legion.

490
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:12,116
Count Zero.

491
00:50:15,994 --> 00:50:19,987
If you give me the logic of the layout,
I can get us out of here.

492
00:51:16,988 --> 00:51:18,387
How did they know?

493
00:51:24,162 --> 00:51:25,959
Kimbral was trying to upstage you.

494
00:51:37,242 --> 00:51:38,903
You told me everything.

495
00:51:41,479 --> 00:51:43,208
You work for the prison.

496
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:47,010
I run the prison.

497
00:52:00,432 --> 00:52:02,923
Our Jasper Kimbral? I don't get it.

498
00:52:03,768 --> 00:52:06,261
You got to follow the footprints
from the time he left this place

499
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,363
to wherever he is now.

500
00:52:08,373 --> 00:52:09,601
Hades has got to be somewhere.

501
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:11,708
Yeah, the underworld.

502
00:52:13,445 --> 00:52:14,805
Abigail, can you give us a minute?

503
00:52:20,051 --> 00:52:21,075
Okay.

504
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,716
I know we've had our differences,
but I got to hear it from you.

505
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:26,120
Swear to me we're okay.

506
00:52:28,226 --> 00:52:30,346
What are you talking about, man?
Of course we're good.

507
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:31,786
All right.

508
00:52:31,896 --> 00:52:34,296
And you're still paying me
good money to hack shit, right?

509
00:52:35,867 --> 00:52:37,266
Why would I mess that up?

510
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:40,130
So what've you been working on
behind closed doors?

511
00:52:43,908 --> 00:52:45,876
Let's just say I'm working on something

512
00:52:45,944 --> 00:52:48,037
that will improve the communications
between us.

513
00:52:57,755 --> 00:53:00,622
Hello, Shu. You've met my zookeeper.

514
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:09,893
We couldn't break 'em.

515
00:53:11,636 --> 00:53:12,660
Extraordinary.

516
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:16,600
Three men,
and they wouldn't turn on one another.

517
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:21,240
But you...

518
00:53:23,515 --> 00:53:25,073
you've got them on your side.

519
00:53:26,784 --> 00:53:28,445
You got them to trust you.

520
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:37,794
I've waited a long time
to see that look on your face.

521
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:46,466
Look who's here. It's Lukey.

522
00:53:47,272 --> 00:53:51,003
Aw, come on. Aren't you guys happy
to see each other?

523
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,782
When the investors of this place
found out that Ray Breslin's protégé

524
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:03,287
had been cut loose, you can imagine.

525
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:07,151
Breslin cost them a lot of money
on their last investment.

526
00:54:07,225 --> 00:54:09,625
These people do not like losing money.

527
00:54:11,362 --> 00:54:12,829
They needed someone better...

528
00:54:14,032 --> 00:54:15,226
more current,

529
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,332
so... voilà.

530
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:20,664
Welcome to Hades.

531
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,003
So, we're here
because you want your revenge.

532
00:54:26,511 --> 00:54:27,637
Yes.

533
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:32,512
Unwavering, complete and definitive.

534
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,890
See, everyone in this zoo
is worth money to me.

535
00:54:42,994 --> 00:54:45,224
They all have information
that someone out there

536
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,195
thinks is worth millions of dollars...

537
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:51,034
especially your cousin Yusheng.

538
00:54:53,504 --> 00:54:57,201
You two... you're worth nothing to me.

539
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:00,289
Then why don't you kill us
and get it over with?

540
00:55:01,112 --> 00:55:02,792
Where's your fighting spirit at, Luke?
Huh?

541
00:55:04,082 --> 00:55:06,414
This place is designed to give you hope.

542
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:09,019
You win a battle, you get benefits.

543
00:55:09,087 --> 00:55:11,749
Read a book. Make art.

544
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:15,383
You lose a battle, then you lose food.

545
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,259
Start to doubt yourself.

546
00:55:18,029 --> 00:55:21,192
Then you set goals, and you rise again.

547
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:25,764
All the drama of the human condition
is represented right here

548
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:27,404
in my zoo.

549
00:55:29,574 --> 00:55:31,906
I'm gonna make sure that you two
have plenty to do.

550
00:55:33,945 --> 00:55:37,381
When you wake up, you'll be the men
who sold out Count Zero.

551
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:41,949
That should give you a unique perspective
on the human condition.

552
00:55:42,053 --> 00:55:45,216
Inmate 1764, report for battle in the zoo.

553
00:55:52,563 --> 00:55:55,396
Inmate 1924, report for battle in the zoo.

554
00:56:36,107 --> 00:56:37,107
Begin battle.

555
00:57:19,817 --> 00:57:23,548
When he's in the zoo,
make sure he fights every day.

556
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,822
There are no more truce days for Shu...

557
00:57:30,228 --> 00:57:33,925
until his will is broken
and we have Yusheng's technology.

558
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,710
So you have no layout.
There is no routine.

559
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,448
And you have no help.

560
00:57:54,952 --> 00:57:59,082
But there's always a plan B,
even for these assholes.

561
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:04,553
They try to make this place
look totally automated,

562
00:58:04,629 --> 00:58:06,597
but you saw those human guards.

563
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:11,300
That's their plan B.

564
00:58:13,437 --> 00:58:14,870
What is yours, Shu?

565
00:58:20,578 --> 00:58:21,636
They're alive.

566
00:58:27,218 --> 00:58:29,152
Kimbral, report.

567
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:31,787
We're closer than ever
to breaking Yusheng.

568
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,953
Closer? Well, report back when you do.

569
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:40,898
Focus more on getting that patent
than your revenge.

570
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:44,629
It's a risk bringing him here.

571
00:58:49,607 --> 00:58:51,268
He beat their last facility.

572
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,435
I'm gonna show them he can't beat mine.

573
00:59:07,191 --> 00:59:08,191
Let's see some hands!

574
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:09,292
Now! Let's see 'em!

575
00:59:12,129 --> 00:59:13,653
Target's compliant.

576
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:16,739
- Yeah, we got him.
- Bringing him in now.

577
00:59:18,803 --> 00:59:19,963
Lock him up, lock him...

578
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:51,962
Before it was all theoretical.

579
00:59:52,536 --> 00:59:54,060
What design is best,

580
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:56,537
what strategy works against what defense.

581
00:59:57,208 --> 00:59:58,402
But now it's real.

582
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:01,310
You against me.

583
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:06,248
All right, you won.

584
01:00:08,986 --> 01:00:09,986
Not yet.

585
01:00:11,822 --> 01:00:16,225
I wanted to go more algorithms,
let the machines run the show.

586
01:00:16,894 --> 01:00:18,259
You said no.

587
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:23,399
You talked about human intuition.
The value of teamwork.

588
01:00:24,602 --> 01:00:26,001
Well, there's three of you now.

589
01:00:28,105 --> 01:00:29,367
Show me.

590
01:00:33,577 --> 01:00:35,545
All prisoners report to the zoo.

591
01:00:35,613 --> 01:00:38,582
I repeat, all prisoners report to the zoo.

592
01:00:47,858 --> 01:00:51,453
Inmate 9051, report for battle in the zoo.

593
01:00:51,562 --> 01:00:54,122
I repeat, report for battle in the zoo.

594
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:26,426
Begin battle.

595
01:01:51,288 --> 01:01:55,122
Battle is over. I repeat, battle is over.

596
01:02:22,787 --> 01:02:24,880
You have one new message.

597
01:02:25,556 --> 01:02:28,491
DeRosa, it's Hush. They took Breslin.

598
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,491
All our guys are in Hades.

599
01:02:31,162 --> 01:02:33,082
You're the only one
that can help us get 'em out.

600
01:02:33,731 --> 01:02:34,731
Call me.

601
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:48,068
Shu... you can't give up.

602
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:52,513
What would you know about giving up?

603
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:57,083
You never stood for anything.

604
01:02:58,722 --> 01:03:00,019
Shu, I'm sorry.

605
01:03:00,091 --> 01:03:02,525
You just wanted to be rich.

606
01:03:02,593 --> 01:03:03,821
What's wrong with that?

607
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:07,223
My family never had any money.

608
01:03:08,365 --> 01:03:10,560
And when your parents died,
we had to pay for you, too.

609
01:03:10,668 --> 01:03:12,260
Okay? Don't you ever forget that.

610
01:03:14,572 --> 01:03:16,870
Go ahead. Go ahead!

611
01:03:17,408 --> 01:03:19,569
Lash out! Do it!

612
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:23,436
It's what you've always done
when you can't control things.

613
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:27,080
You're always the same.

614
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:36,051
What?

615
01:03:36,427 --> 01:03:37,519
You are right.

616
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,730
I'm predictable.

617
01:03:43,634 --> 01:03:45,602
Kimbral knew what we were gonna do.

618
01:03:47,104 --> 01:03:48,731
He played to my arrogance.

619
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:53,274
He knew I'd take it upon myself
to get us out.

620
01:03:54,812 --> 01:03:56,609
He played us perfectly.

621
01:03:58,582 --> 01:03:59,742
How do we play him?

622
01:04:00,317 --> 01:04:01,648
Plan B.

623
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:06,755
We stop being so predictable.

624
01:04:12,897 --> 01:04:14,262
I'm ready to talk.

625
01:04:16,066 --> 01:04:18,091
The tech details are complex.

626
01:04:18,836 --> 01:04:21,100
I will give them to you in stages.

627
01:04:21,172 --> 01:04:24,266
Give me everything, or no deal.

628
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:40,456
- We're in.
- Ray, you hear me?

629
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:42,924
- I can hear you clearly.
- Yes!

630
01:04:42,993 --> 01:04:45,860
Who knew your amateur
dentist skills would pay off?

631
01:04:45,963 --> 01:04:49,194
Now aren't you glad I spent all of those
company hours in my playroom?

632
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,962
- What do you got?
- I been up for three nights straight.

633
01:04:52,036 --> 01:04:53,936
Password breaker hit the mother lode.

634
01:04:54,004 --> 01:04:56,302
I'm through the firewall
and into the Galileo mainframe.

635
01:04:56,373 --> 01:04:58,466
Receiving good reads
from all systems at Hades.

636
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:02,672
My best GPS spiders are working overtime,
and we only have <i>33o%</i> of the layout.

637
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:05,039
No exact exit strategy for you.

638
01:05:05,149 --> 01:05:07,117
We need an access point from the inside.

639
01:05:07,818 --> 01:05:09,479
You need to get Yusheng to work on it.

640
01:05:10,054 --> 01:05:12,147
We got eyes on us 24/7.

641
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:15,625
- Can you get the cameras?
- Yeah.

642
01:05:15,693 --> 01:05:17,991
- I can guarantee a minute.
- Seventy seconds.

643
01:05:18,062 --> 01:05:20,121
Maybe 70 seconds,
but after that, it's gonna know.

644
01:05:20,197 --> 01:05:21,323
I'll take it.

645
01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:24,834
There's one more thing I want you to do.

646
01:05:25,302 --> 01:05:28,897
Can you get access to Galileo's voice box?

647
01:05:35,512 --> 01:05:36,809
What's wrong with the boom box?

648
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,007
<i>Let's move together. Flo was one.</i>

649
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,711
That's Qingdao.

650
01:05:52,096 --> 01:05:54,997
Cameras 48 through 58 cover spoke B.

651
01:05:55,065 --> 01:05:56,555
We can clear it in 30 seconds.

652
01:06:07,444 --> 01:06:08,444
Now.

653
01:06:11,348 --> 01:06:12,372
Sixty-eight.

654
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:15,445
Sixty-six.

655
01:06:15,552 --> 01:06:17,452
You managed to learn my language
after all.

656
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:19,579
We only got about 70 seconds.

657
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:21,749
Hush is trying to get the critical data,

658
01:06:21,859 --> 01:06:24,623
but he's only got
<i>33o%</i> of the layout so far.

659
01:06:24,728 --> 01:06:26,855
No direct paths to the exits.

660
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,192
He's hacking Galileo?

661
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:32,202
- Affirmative. He's gonna need our help.
- Less than 40 seconds.

662
01:06:32,269 --> 01:06:34,066
This is an inverted design

663
01:06:34,138 --> 01:06:36,971
that protects the center and control rooms
from the outside in,

664
01:06:37,074 --> 01:06:38,905
that's what makes it so difficult.

665
01:06:39,476 --> 01:06:42,411
We need to give him
a physical access point from the inside.

666
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:44,640
Talk to Yusheng. Get him to work on it.

667
01:06:44,748 --> 01:06:46,215
Ten seconds. Now.

668
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:47,776
Just be patient.

669
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:57,759
I heard that a car chase went down at
the warehouse complex near the rail yard.

670
01:06:57,828 --> 01:06:59,295
One of the cars was Luke's.

671
01:07:00,097 --> 01:07:01,462
Going down there to check it out.

672
01:07:02,399 --> 01:07:03,457
I'll figure it out.

673
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:05,933
All right. Breslin and the guys
are working from the inside

674
01:07:06,003 --> 01:07:08,403
on a device
that will help us locate Hades.

675
01:07:08,472 --> 01:07:09,496
Great.

676
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:13,674
You find these guys, I want in.

677
01:07:13,777 --> 01:07:14,903
I'll be in touch.

678
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:42,168
The guys we can trust
in most of the spokes are in.

679
01:07:42,272 --> 01:07:43,296
Be ready.

680
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:49,137
The zookeeper has the specs.
Only a matter of time

681
01:07:49,213 --> 01:07:51,647
before whoever he's giving them to
realizes they won't work.

682
01:07:52,182 --> 01:07:55,879
You have never wanted to learn Go.
I'd recommend it.

683
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,019
Patience is the most important part
of this game.

684
01:08:00,124 --> 01:08:02,149
Did you hear what I just said?
We got to go.

685
01:08:02,226 --> 01:08:06,663
We have the manpower, but no way out.
We keep working.

686
01:08:07,131 --> 01:08:09,326
But first, we need your help.

687
01:08:14,705 --> 01:08:17,003
I know you get stuff for inmates.

688
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:20,669
I need a favor, or I tell the machine.

689
01:09:35,619 --> 01:09:37,484
You move all the pieces together.

690
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:40,047
Everything flows as one.

691
01:09:57,608 --> 01:10:00,441
Connection with inside
access point established.

692
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:03,742
Hades located. Scanning layout now.

693
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:15,583
We have the layout. We know their routine.

694
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:16,819
What about help?

695
01:10:18,428 --> 01:10:19,827
We got that covered.

696
01:10:32,709 --> 01:10:35,439
- I'm ready to shut Galileo down.
- Okay.

697
01:10:35,512 --> 01:10:37,605
Our exit strategy is solid,

698
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:40,149
but you still got to get lucky
to get past those human guards.

699
01:10:45,789 --> 01:10:48,121
There's two maintenance doors
on either side of the zoo.

700
01:10:48,191 --> 01:10:49,716
When the lights go out,
you got three minutes

701
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:51,366
before the system starts waking up again.

702
01:11:02,639 --> 01:11:03,639
Showtime.

703
01:11:12,716 --> 01:11:14,411
System under attack.

704
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:19,078
System under attack.

705
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:22,585
System failure.

706
01:11:23,493 --> 01:11:25,051
System failure.

707
01:11:25,162 --> 01:11:26,652
System failure.

708
01:11:29,533 --> 01:11:30,864
All systems down.

709
01:11:30,934 --> 01:11:34,062
Clock's ticking. Time to use those muscles
before the doors relock.

710
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,067
- All right, come on. Push.
- Push.

711
01:12:04,434 --> 01:12:07,301
I am Galileo. All systems online.

712
01:12:09,206 --> 01:12:10,264
Halt!

713
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:14,875
The intruders are heading west
through hall 23.

714
01:12:18,915 --> 01:12:20,644
This way to the medical center.

715
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:28,584
DeRosa, your hunch was right.
Location of Hades confirmed.

716
01:12:28,659 --> 01:12:30,058
Sending you the coordinates now.

717
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:33,122
Communication established.

718
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:35,664
Ray Breslin is attempting to break Hades.

719
01:12:35,766 --> 01:12:37,927
I want you to see how the prison responds.

720
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:41,469
The med bots are still down.

721
01:12:41,972 --> 01:12:44,133
The system isn't fully online.

722
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:50,275
I need you cue balls to cover our back.

723
01:12:52,182 --> 01:12:53,274
We are Legion.

724
01:12:56,453 --> 01:12:58,751
Whatever. Let's go. Come on!

725
01:13:00,023 --> 01:13:01,023
Cover their asses.

726
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:11,592
All communications blocked.
Closed-circuit system activated.

727
01:13:12,602 --> 01:13:14,001
Kimbral cut communications.

728
01:13:14,104 --> 01:13:16,595
He shut us down. Closed off the com link.

729
01:13:16,673 --> 01:13:17,697
What about our bots?

730
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:19,248
They're still working but minimized.

731
01:13:19,309 --> 01:13:21,038
He's walled off Galileo's prime function.

732
01:13:21,144 --> 01:13:22,975
Without a clear channel,
I can't control it.

733
01:13:23,046 --> 01:13:25,947
The intruders are on corridor 37.

734
01:13:26,016 --> 01:13:28,780
Clearing all access to main floor.

735
01:13:28,852 --> 01:13:31,514
Resetting Hades structure
to secure position.

736
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:45,732
Shit. What do we do?

737
01:13:47,871 --> 01:13:49,964
Hades restructure complete.

738
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,302
Galileo...

739
01:13:52,142 --> 01:13:53,507
gas them.

740
01:14:04,254 --> 01:14:06,586
Breslin, Declerc.

741
01:14:07,057 --> 01:14:09,416
Two circular floors
on top of each other like a birthday cake.

742
01:14:09,426 --> 01:14:10,859
The ventilation system.

743
01:14:10,927 --> 01:14:13,862
Two HVACs, flow vents and ceiling.

744
01:14:14,731 --> 01:14:15,731
Up there!

745
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,658
Yusheng. Come on.

746
01:14:30,046 --> 01:14:31,240
There you are.

747
01:14:31,948 --> 01:14:34,280
We're getting pushback
from the terminal in medical.

748
01:14:35,685 --> 01:14:36,845
We're about to have company.

749
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:45,185
Anyone got a coin?

750
01:14:46,096 --> 01:14:47,529
How do you beat a maze?

751
01:14:47,597 --> 01:14:48,962
Stick to the right.

752
01:14:55,105 --> 01:14:57,232
Freeze! Freeze, or we'll open fire!

753
01:15:05,448 --> 01:15:06,608
Seal us up!

754
01:15:13,557 --> 01:15:15,047
Don't know how long we can hold it.

755
01:15:24,434 --> 01:15:25,458
Keep going!

756
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:30,139
I'm going back for Luke.

757
01:15:30,607 --> 01:15:32,247
All right. I'm going to the control room.

758
01:15:32,943 --> 01:15:34,171
Yusheng, come with me.

759
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:49,516
- Freeze!
- Show me your hands!

760
01:15:49,626 --> 01:15:52,424
- Show me your hands!
- Hold it! Don't move!

761
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:54,209
- We are Legion.
- We are Legion.

762
01:15:56,466 --> 01:15:59,765
We got to be in sync.
On one. Three, two, one.

763
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:03,204
- All right, you know what to do.
- Yes. Go.

764
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,662
Medical secured.

765
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,571
Kimbral, report.

766
01:16:39,342 --> 01:16:43,369
He's good, but my machine always wins.

767
01:16:43,914 --> 01:16:45,040
Not sure about that.

768
01:16:48,051 --> 01:16:49,075
Okay.

769
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:53,321
I give up. You got me.

770
01:16:55,325 --> 01:16:56,815
But you're still in Hades.

771
01:16:57,227 --> 01:17:00,822
And with Galileo back to his full power,
I just triggered his autopilot orders.

772
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:04,025
All the systems that Hush was attacking
are now closed.

773
01:17:04,701 --> 01:17:06,100
You're never getting out of here.

774
01:17:11,741 --> 01:17:13,436
You know, kid, I got to give you credit.

775
01:17:14,577 --> 01:17:16,169
You did a great job here.

776
01:17:17,447 --> 01:17:19,540
You built a prison. Looks like it has...

777
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:22,348
no weaknesses.

778
01:17:23,687 --> 01:17:25,245
But you know what?

779
01:17:25,355 --> 01:17:28,256
There is always one.

780
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:12,101
Oh, yeah.

781
01:18:41,464 --> 01:18:44,331
Now I am the zookeeper.

782
01:18:50,473 --> 01:18:52,668
I have this acquaintance friend of mine.

783
01:18:53,543 --> 01:18:56,034
Big guy. And he did me a favor.

784
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,813
I gave him this account number, special.

785
01:18:59,883 --> 01:19:02,647
Couldn't crack the code, but he did.

786
01:19:03,219 --> 01:19:06,211
And he traced the money,
and he traced the account.

787
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:08,484
Sparrow.

788
01:19:09,893 --> 01:19:13,124
And you're the one who's behind all this.

789
01:19:14,664 --> 01:19:16,063
Then we made a plan.

790
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,737
Solar system failure.
Solar system heating up.

791
01:19:28,645 --> 01:19:31,045
I just told you Galileo
was back to his full power.

792
01:19:31,648 --> 01:19:32,876
It doesn't need solar.

793
01:19:33,883 --> 01:19:34,883
Let it blow.

794
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:49,755
There's the opening, DeRosa, as promised.

795
01:19:51,768 --> 01:19:52,928
Yusheng.

796
01:19:56,172 --> 01:19:57,537
- Freeze!
- Get down!

797
01:19:59,409 --> 01:20:00,409
Freeze!

798
01:20:02,045 --> 01:20:04,605
I could've been looking for this place
for a long time.

799
01:20:05,715 --> 01:20:07,205
I would've found it,

800
01:20:07,283 --> 01:20:10,013
but it's a lot tougher breaking in
from the outside.

801
01:20:10,887 --> 01:20:13,947
But I knew that wasn't gonna happen
because I know you.

802
01:20:15,191 --> 01:20:16,385
I know how you think...

803
01:20:17,227 --> 01:20:21,459
and I knew you would be
coming for me, and you did.

804
01:20:22,298 --> 01:20:25,028
I'm glad, 'cause I like working,

805
01:20:25,101 --> 01:20:28,093
as you can see, from the inside out.

806
01:20:29,606 --> 01:20:34,202
Hades had one very, very, very weak spot.

807
01:20:38,815 --> 01:20:40,043
You.

808
01:20:50,093 --> 01:20:53,494
Security breach at main door.
Forced entry.

809
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:56,162
Hades compromised.

810
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,324
It's time. Let's finish it right.

811
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,743
Stop! Stop! Get on the ground!

812
01:21:16,085 --> 01:21:18,451
On the ground now! Let's go!

813
01:21:18,922 --> 01:21:20,116
Down! Down on the ground!

814
01:21:40,343 --> 01:21:42,709
DeRosa, long time no see.

815
01:21:42,812 --> 01:21:45,872
Nice PJs. Where's your fucking teddy bear?

816
01:21:47,984 --> 01:21:51,511
Prisoner9051,
report for battle in the zoo.

817
01:21:55,024 --> 01:21:57,219
Let's see what you can do
without your tech.

818
01:21:59,562 --> 01:22:02,463
After I put my fist through your face,
I'm gonna crucify you, kid.

819
01:23:18,975 --> 01:23:20,067
What'd I miss?

820
01:23:28,117 --> 01:23:29,709
Guess that makes us even.

821
01:23:29,786 --> 01:23:31,048
Thanks, Luke.

822
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,144
Yeah.

823
01:24:26,476 --> 01:24:27,476
Hey!

824
01:24:27,543 --> 01:24:29,477
- Relax.
- There he is.

825
01:24:29,545 --> 01:24:31,012
Nice of you to join us.

826
01:24:31,681 --> 01:24:32,807
Had some free time.

827
01:24:41,157 --> 01:24:42,454
Get in, get in, get in!

828
01:24:56,072 --> 01:24:57,471
Hush, you hear me?

829
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,474
Good to hear you. We thought we lost you.

830
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:02,234
Shu and Yusheng are safe and sound.

831
01:25:02,345 --> 01:25:03,676
How about that?

832
01:25:03,746 --> 01:25:05,509
Plan B actually worked.

833
01:25:08,151 --> 01:25:11,882
Remember, Shu, with brains and patience,
nothing's impossible.

834
01:25:20,096 --> 01:25:21,859
Can somebody tell me
where the hell we are?

835
01:25:21,931 --> 01:25:23,131
You want to tell him, big guy?

836
01:25:25,268 --> 01:25:26,360
Not really.

837
01:25:27,036 --> 01:25:28,036
Atlanta.

838
01:25:28,504 --> 01:25:29,994
Are you fucking kidding me?

839
01:25:30,072 --> 01:25:31,752
Hades is in Atlanta? How is that possible?

840
01:25:33,376 --> 01:25:36,277
Kimbral, come in. Report.

841
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,672
You're not Kimbral.

842
01:25:41,384 --> 01:25:42,408
No, I'm not.

843
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,447
But I got to tell you something.
I'm really getting sick of this shit.

844
01:25:48,925 --> 01:25:50,222
So whoever you are...

845
01:25:51,461 --> 01:25:52,461
wherever you are...

846
01:25:54,864 --> 01:25:55,888
we're gonna find you...

847
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,400
for sure.

848
01:25:59,305 --> 01:26:05,449
