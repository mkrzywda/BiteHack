2
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:28,662
Well, just great!

3
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:33,216
No, not the presentation.
That's terrible. Some idiot just hit me.

4
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:37,004
Do you realize how much
this is going to cost?

5
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:40,786
Not in money,
which I have plenty of, but in...

6
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:44,007
What the...

7
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:47,127
Get away from me! Get away!

8
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,867
Help me. Someone help!

9
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:59,204
Stay away!

10
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,493
What are you doing?

11
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,853
Look out!

12
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:27,268
Wonder Woman! Save me! Save me from them!

13
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:29,708
- From whom?
- Demons.

14
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:31,739
They're everywhere. Don't you see them?

15
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:44,197
I see only one.

16
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,529
I'll ask you one last time.

17
00:01:55,997 --> 00:01:58,232
What did you do with my family?

18
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:01,933
Steven, it's me, Gloria!

19
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,308
I'm your wife.

20
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,476
These are our children.

21
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:12,900
You're not my family!
You killed them, just like the others.

22
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,249
Now it's your turn.

23
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:24,245
- No one's dying here tonight.
- It's not me you should be stopping.

24
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:26,995
It's them. Look at them!

25
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:31,533
Look at them!

26
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:42,646
It's just like the neighbors.
Go to my shed. You'll see I'm right!

27
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:02,732
What have you done?

28
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:29,259
Let me help you.

29
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:32,247
It's not my fault.

30
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:36,399
I've given birth to the devil.
It's the devil!

31
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,956
You're tired. Give me the baby.

32
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:43,273
You don't want to hurt her.

33
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,059
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,360
These crimes were committed
by law-abiding citizens.

35
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,430
They all claim to have seen
nightmare visions beforehand.

36
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,197
- Any clue what's causing it?
- No idea.

37
00:04:57,414 --> 00:05:00,603
The one week I fill in for Jordan,
and it couldn't be some hairy-ass monster?

38
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:03,640
The same pattern is repeating
around the world,

39
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,674
so there could be an overriding factor.

40
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:07,778
Perhaps a paranormal element.

41
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,013
Are you talking about magic?

42
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,915
We've come up against
magic before, Batman.

43
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:17,486
- Xerxes, Trigon, Felix Faust.
- Even Shazam's powers are based in magic.

44
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,038
With as much as you've seen,
can you rule it out?

45
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:23,677
The criminally insane
don't need magic as an excuse.

46
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:28,030
I recommend spending more time
on the streets instead of flying over them.

47
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,017
He's even friendlier than they say.

48
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:59,907
Bollocks! In what bloody plane of
existence does four of a kind lose?

49
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:04,810
Too, too bad, Constantine.

50
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:10,147
Have you gained weight?
It looks good on you.

51
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:13,304
What say you let your soul mate
play a few hands, Jason?

52
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:16,840
Maybe he'd change my luck.
He'd definitely be less mopey than you.

53
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,778
John Constantine, the man
who perfected the bad idea.

54
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,543
The only reason I came
to this dung heap of a casino

55
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:27,651
is to find a relic to keep
that monster locked away forever.

56
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:31,838
Boys, boys! You're boring me.
Let's play, shall we?

57
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:52,610
My luck's running
as hot as me naughty bits.

58
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,982
But our next group of friends is due
to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.

59
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,452
Copperfield's coming. Presto changeo!

60
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:05,723
Woman in a box. In a box.

61
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:09,160
Yeah, he's classy, unlike you.

62
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,947
Are they implying David Copperfield,
television magician, has true power?

63
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:18,801
Owns a chain of islands and dated
Claudia Schiffer. What do you think?

64
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:24,341
No cards for me, and...

65
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,513
Looks like you can't call
my bet, Constantine.

66
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,316
By my rules, you lose.

67
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,853
- I raise.
- With what?

68
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:37,170
- Your ratty soul ain't worth two bits.
- Not two bits.

69
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:41,885
I'm betting the House,
the House of Mystery.

70
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:50,475
And since I'm including everything inside,
it looks like you're the one

71
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:52,952
that can't call, Abnegazar.

72
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:55,608
Well, what do you say, boys?

73
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:57,996
I like the action.

74
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,058
I call.

75
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:21,400
Really? A chipped Dreamstone?

76
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,336
I'm out.

77
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:27,824
Broken knick-knacks for the House of
Mystery and its contents? Are you mad?

78
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:31,374
I've got a working soul catcher.

79
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:34,516
That's Ogid's Eye Spiker?

80
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:35,941
And the Garazi.

81
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:41,036
So even if that very magical Dreamstone
doesn't work, it's still a big-ass ruby.

82
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:46,107
I'd be a poor sport indeed
if I didn't accept your fair wager.

83
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:57,035
Hell. Now, that's
a losing hand for the ages.

84
00:09:57,115 --> 00:10:00,405
Now, read them and...

85
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:04,325
- What?
- Do they have an eye doctor in hell?

86
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:08,541
- I'd make an appointment if I was you.
- You cheated!

87
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:14,987
Technically, we both cheated.
I just did it better.

88
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:19,140
- I'll rip your bloody heart out!
- Sorry, mate, I'm using that.

89
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:39,696
Situation here, Jason.
It's time to call your better half.

90
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:42,967
Sorry, John, you're on your own.

91
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:56,495
Oi, I'm gonna roast your nuts
and feed them to you, Constantine.

92
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:07,289
Gone, gone, the form of man.

93
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:10,776
Arise the demon, Etrigan!

94
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:17,835
Once more with words of metered rhyme

95
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:21,573
comes Etrigan the Slayer just in time.

96
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:25,176
Easy now, brother.
We're on the same side, right?

97
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:27,612
Let's use our words.

98
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:30,981
Are you having a laugh?
We're the Demons Three.

99
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:33,064
Kill everyone!

100
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:45,063
You will pay, Constantine.

101
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:47,599
Your soul will be ours.

102
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,915
Get in line, you prats.

103
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,747
Your ass is grass, Constantine.

104
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:07,065
And we're the lawnmower.

105
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:10,921
Since the battle's fought and won,

106
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,540
Jason Blood with me is done.

107
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:27,071
For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan,

108
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:31,408
fighting to keep him from coming forth,
and you forced me to summon him.

109
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:33,561
Everything got sorted.

110
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:37,272
He could have gone on a killing spree.
You don't think.

111
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:40,269
- You don't consider the cost.
- Yeah, I did.

112
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:44,470
Weighed it against my being eaten alive
and thought, "Yeah, totally worth it."

113
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:49,293
You're a world class bastard, John.

114
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:23,417
And for my finale, I will make this
terrible trio of terrifying Tantors

115
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,911
vanish before your eyes.

116
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:54,125
I hope those elephants survived.

117
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:56,929
You don't want PETA on your back.

118
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,513
You're assuming they were real
in the first place.

119
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:05,604
- How are you, Bruce?
- I'm fine, Zatanna. Busy.

120
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:08,708
You know where I can find
John Constantine?

121
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:11,327
- No.
- You must have some idea.

122
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,512
We don't keep in touch.

123
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:16,195
I know you two have history, so I...

124
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:22,655
Z, Batman needs to talk with John.

125
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,824
You've got to come along, too.
It's important.

126
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:27,593
- Is that you, Boston?
- Yeah.

127
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:31,545
Everything is...
Boy, this guy's mind is tough.

128
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,332
Can't hold...

129
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,139
What is going on?

130
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:42,823
I'll tell you on the way to John's.

131
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:46,076
Okay, but I call shotgun.

132
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,752
I don't even think
his kid could fit back here.

133
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,121
Sorry, Boston, but life is for the living.

134
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:58,122
Boston Brand. He was a circus performer.

135
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:02,660
Batman's heard of me. Sweet.
Tell him I'm a fan of his, too,

136
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,233
but, you know, be cool about it.

137
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:09,102
- Yeah, that's him.
- Ask him if he caught one of my shows.

138
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:14,172
He was a trapeze artist who loved being
famous, especially with the ladies.

139
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:17,477
- Husbands, not so much.
- You're killing me.

140
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:20,279
He had a knack for irritating
the wrong people.

141
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:24,463
<i>Then, about five years ago,
karma caught up with him.</i>

142
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:31,223
<i>It was a weekend show, full house.</i>

143
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:35,776
<i>Boston was in the middle
of his death-defying act when...</i>

144
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:04,992
<i>he died, and that should have been that,</i>

145
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:08,930
<i>but with Boston,
things tend to get complicated.</i>

146
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,834
<i>His spirit was called
by the goddess Rama Kushna.</i>

147
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:19,205
<i>She took pity on him and gave him
the power to possess the living,</i>

148
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:22,041
so he could bring his killer
and others to justice.

149
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:24,178
Hey, I don't wanna brag, but I'm good.

150
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:27,419
Why did he feel the need
to write on my walls like a child?

151
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:29,330
Yeah, he's sorry about that.

152
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:35,889
Where is this address? GPS doesn't
seem especially useful tonight.

153
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:40,294
It's not an address. The House
of Mystery tends to move around.

154
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,398
I didn't put the symbols in there
for the GPS to find it.

155
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:46,301
I wanted the House to come to us.

156
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:42,405
She can't hold it. Do something.

157
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,057
There.

158
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:09,965
Into the House!

159
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,433
- Z, you all right?
- Yeah, as soon as you get off me.

160
00:18:25,913 --> 00:18:29,705
I should have known you were the reason
I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.

161
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,574
The House always did like you better.

162
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:36,278
Odd trio for a road trip.
To what do I owe the visit?

163
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:40,354
The League thinks that a recent spike
in homicides may have a magical cause.

164
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:48,222
Told you something stinks. Now we know
someone doesn't want us asking questions.

165
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,692
Looks like you've cracked it
wide open, mate.

166
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:52,360
What did he say?

167
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,178
I'm not playing telephone between you two.

168
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,351
We online?

169
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:05,873
Great. Sorry about the Batmobile.
I hope your insurance was paid up.

170
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,090
What, is there even a policy
for something like that?

171
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,784
Hey, I told you not to do that, Orchid.
Use a bloody door.

172
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:17,600
I am glad to see you are well.

173
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:23,559
- How new is this one?
- Not what you think.

174
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:25,560
It's the magic of the House.

175
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,764
Decided it wanted to experience
humanity and gave itself a body.

176
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:31,882
It sure did.

177
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:37,606
A spirit whose existence
is not its own, like myself.

178
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:40,123
Interesting.

179
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:45,146
Yeah, we are that.

180
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,851
Dead smooth you are, mate.

181
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:50,936
Hey, it's been a while, you know?

182
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:57,966
Powerful in true magic. Angry at John.

183
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:00,730
This, I understand.

184
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,269
Yet you still have feelings for him.

185
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:08,003
I could kill him.

186
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,646
You exude pain.

187
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:22,285
Your life is a patchwork of blackness
with no time for joy.

188
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:25,137
How do you cope with it?

189
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:29,040
I have a butler.

190
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:34,011
That was enlightening.

191
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:40,418
Well, I guess we should have
that chinwag about now.

192
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,889
- <i>Demons!</i>
- <i>It's not me!</i>

193
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:50,445
<i>I've given birth to the devil. It's the...</i>

194
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:53,934
Rama Kushna says this will break down
the walls between the planes.

195
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:56,019
Even the afterlife will be affected.

196
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:59,354
Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.
I'll look into it.

197
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:02,458
Meanwhile, the House
will drop you wherever you'd like.

198
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,729
Rama says we have to work together.
Come on! It's a dream team.

199
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:10,099
You, me, Zatanna, Batman,
maybe even the Justice League.

200
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:14,470
The capes and tights crew,
useless against dark magic.

201
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,874
That's why we need you. You can lead us.

202
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:22,579
Boston, do I strike you as a team player?
Much less a team leader.

203
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:25,816
Point is, even deities can get it wrong.

204
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:29,385
It's how we got the appendix,
Neanderthals and reality TV.

205
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,589
Z, your help I could use.

206
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:34,558
Okay, if we do it as a group.

207
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,296
This is the monkey cage
in Sumatra all over again.

208
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:42,516
"We need to save the monkeys," she said.

209
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:46,404
- You're such an ass.
- Not the monkeys.

210
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:51,008
Says the man who has Newcastle
and 100 other screw-ups on his resume,

211
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:54,560
- costing lives and souls.
- But not monkeys.

212
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,281
- You're still way ahead on dead monkeys.
- They used to be a thing.

213
00:21:57,361 --> 00:22:00,365
- You just have to make things...
- We're wasting time.

214
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:05,263
He's dead, and I accept the risks,
so can we get to it,

215
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:07,973
or do you two need a timeout?

216
00:22:10,474 --> 00:22:14,013
Fine and dandy. Let's take a walk
on the dark side then.

217
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:19,885
Coming, team?

218
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:29,213
Stop being a child and slow down.
Where are we going?

219
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:32,265
- Ritchie's.
- Have you talked to him lately?

220
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:35,218
I know he's pissed.
You don't have to remind me, love.

221
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:40,139
- It's on my CV, remember?
- No, really, has he told you...

222
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:44,847
No. He's dying.

223
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:47,565
John Constantine,

224
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:53,304
purveyor of the dark arts
and lifeline of last resort.

225
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:59,676
No matter. Your friend's soul
will be collected,

226
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:03,864
and there's nothing
you can do to alter that.

227
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:07,851
Why don't you go do something
useful, like haunt a house?

228
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:12,839
- Who's he talking to now?
- Shrouds. They deliver souls to hell.

229
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:16,962
They're drawn to you.

230
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,932
Maybe it's your cologne, Batsy.

231
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:24,142
This one has cheated us many times.

232
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:26,903
It is vexing.

233
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:35,612
This has been lovely,
but it's time for you lot to bugger off.

234
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:42,387
When the time comes, I'll be the one
to collect your soul, Constantine.

235
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,504
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:50,329
I thought I felt
a disturbance in the force.

237
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,046
How you doing, Johnny boy?

238
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:58,905
Zatanna and Batman?

239
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:02,139
What the hell?

240
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,944
Tell you everything inside, mate.

241
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:14,820
You poor thing.

242
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,156
Yeah, I may have lied
the last time we talked,

243
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:22,059
about exactly how fast
I'm sledding downhill.

244
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:24,244
I'm sorry about that.

245
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,533
But it means a lot you're here, John.

246
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:32,138
And, hey, you don't have
to say it. You're forgiven.

247
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:35,541
Still wondering what Batman's
doing in my living room.

248
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:38,958
And when is he gonna shut up, right?

249
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:42,796
What? What's with the face?

250
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:46,617
You're not here to say
you're sorry, are you?

251
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:51,740
Of course I am, but I was looking
to borrow the Keshanti Key as well.

252
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,560
Unbelievable.

253
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,430
- I tried to tell him on the way.
- Yeah, it's not your fault, Z.

254
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,934
Just like everything,
this is rock star Johnny's fault.

255
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:05,738
I was with you when it happened,
Ritchie. We were side by side.

256
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:08,006
Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side.

257
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:11,583
But I got the weird
magical cancer while you,

258
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:13,739
you added to your rep. Isn't that right?

259
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:17,216
Look, me not making proper amends
isn't related to the Key,

260
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:20,303
which, truth be told,
you're not gonna need, mate.

261
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:22,102
John!

262
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:29,477
Getting that a lot lately.

263
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:32,832
You can go screw yourself.
I am not giving you crap.

264
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:35,769
Your anger is understandable,
but you need to reconsider.

265
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:38,287
Innocent lives are at stake.

266
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:52,951
Well, doctors say
an upbeat attitude can help,

267
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:57,758
so what I'll focus on today
is that I met Batman.

268
00:25:57,838 --> 00:26:02,495
Force of good.
It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.

269
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:05,379
Now, if you'll excuse me...

270
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:11,252
You can show yourselves out.

271
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,712
This him?

272
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:42,351
Father of the year.
I'll need the gear now.

273
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:48,107
- How does this work?
- It's basically a magical shortcut.

274
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:50,144
It lets me access
different planes of existence

275
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,611
without doing 20-odd hours
of incantations.

276
00:26:52,691 --> 00:26:53,884
In this case,

277
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:57,936
I'll poke around this poor sod's memories
to see how his madness began.

278
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:02,753
And, more importantly, what caused it.

279
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:08,144
What are you doing here?
I'm calling security.

280
00:27:10,544 --> 00:27:13,750
I'll make sure the looky-loos
stay out of our hair.

281
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:18,922
Z, give me a psychic shout
if this body comes under attack.

282
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:20,675
Wouldn't do to be trapped inside, now.

283
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:24,194
Wouldn't do to go in alone,
and since I'm right here...

284
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:27,464
Too dangerous.
You're out of practice, love.

285
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:30,284
Look, you wanted me along. I'm here.

286
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:33,802
I'm not waiting in the wings.
Let's do this.

287
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:02,316
Z? You okay?

288
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:04,054
I'm fine.

289
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:12,793
I've never liked this sort of magic.

290
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:15,596
I can feel darkness seeping inside me.

291
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:18,348
How you stand it is beyond me.

292
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:22,270
It's all about control.
If you ever need a refresher...

293
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,990
We've had this conversation.
I haven't changed my mind.

294
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,947
Sure, sit out the war
between good and evil.

295
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:35,484
After all, you've got a good thing going
being applauded by mindless twits.

296
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:37,652
Really? Now?

297
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,404
Good a time as ever, I reckon.

298
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,674
- I'll teach you to talk back.
- No!

299
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,761
The magic I perform
brings people happiness.

300
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:49,031
You sure it's not
the two drink minimum, love?

301
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:50,799
You're such a pessimist.

302
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:53,363
Wrong. I expect the worst,

303
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:57,304
so I prepare for the worst,
and when the worst happens, I'm ready.

304
00:28:57,384 --> 00:29:00,541
But my outlook doesn't alter
the reality of the world.

305
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:03,611
- <i>Steven, stop!</i>
- <i>Leave me alone!</i>

306
00:29:03,891 --> 00:29:06,214
Another precious moment.

307
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:08,449
There was joy, too.

308
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,833
His madness swept it away.

309
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:52,409
Who dropped the bed pan?

310
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:29,165
This is it.
This was the morning of his madness.

311
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,634
- What do you think will set him off?
- My guess is the Sudoku.

312
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:35,104
He's got two 9s in the same row.

313
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:36,853
John.

314
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:49,384
Run! Run! Run!

315
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:52,769
Run! Let's get out of here!

316
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:00,477
Come on, fellow. Eat a piece of fruit?

317
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:11,749
Here it is.

318
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,093
We've got to get out of here.

319
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:24,615
One more second.

320
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,801
Now, John. There's no time.

321
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,409
Got it.

322
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:05,456
- Shit's really hit the fan.
- You had to go there, Boston.

323
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,040
Let's get the hell out of here.

324
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:20,904
- I don't recognize it.
- Me, neither.

325
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:23,674
But if there's a person alive
who can, it's Ritchie.

326
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:26,676
Are you forgetting when you made
your friend despise you?

327
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,295
This is too bloody important
for hurt feelings.

328
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,556
- Constantine.
- Bollocks.

329
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,640
You've arrived in time to witness my...

330
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,077
Ritchie!

331
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:50,568
Get back, you bastards!

332
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:52,918
John, help Ritchie.

333
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:56,923
Take that! Boom!

334
00:33:57,121 --> 00:34:01,026
- No pulse.
- We know! We know! Come on!

335
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:17,564
Why?

336
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:25,236
I see you have a few tricks of your own?

337
00:34:25,316 --> 00:34:27,587
Not everything requires magic.

338
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:46,157
Make sure he sees that
right when he wakes up.

339
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:48,007
If he wakes.

340
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:54,900
We need to talk, you and I,
but if you try and summon Etrigan,

341
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,705
I'll fill your lungs with bile
before the first verse is done.

342
00:34:58,785 --> 00:34:59,991
Savvy?

343
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:10,047
The situation was not how it seemed.

344
00:35:10,127 --> 00:35:14,101
The apartment was like that
when I arrived. Richard as well.

345
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:17,689
- Come on! You were all over him.
- I was attempting to help.

346
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:21,175
When you burst in,
I knew I'd get blamed, so I ran.

347
00:35:21,255 --> 00:35:24,763
- Do you believe him?
- Jason's not the murdery type.

348
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:28,601
He's chock full of honor, loyalty,
and rubbish of that sort.

349
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:31,085
Then tell us why you were there.

350
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:35,858
Richard is known as a collector
of the arcane and supernatural.

351
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:40,230
I wanted to see if he had something
that could gain me access to this place.

352
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,764
Why would you wanna break in here?

353
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:45,419
For this.

354
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:49,939
The single most powerful conduit
of evil in the history of the world.

355
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:52,676
He named it the Dreamstone.

356
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:56,043
But it's really the stuff of nightmares.

357
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:01,367
<i>I was a young knight, green as grass.</i>

358
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:05,404
<i>With visions of battle-won glory
dancing in my head.</i>

359
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:09,925
<i>Needless to say,
these were dispelled thoroughly.</i>

360
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,443
<i>He called himself Destiny,</i>

361
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:17,384
<i>but Merlin told us he
was a man of science one time,</i>

362
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:19,499
<i>before he went insane.</i>

363
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:23,789
<i>Destiny forged the Dreamstone
with black magic and his soul.</i>

364
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:27,560
<i>He used it to subject people
to their most terrifying nightmares</i>

365
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,112
<i>and then feed off their torment.</i>

366
00:37:41,714 --> 00:37:45,221
<i>It was actually the demon Etrigan
who won the day.</i>

367
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:52,812
To battle, Etrigan. Should you succeed,
I will release you of your bond to me.

368
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:55,765
If freedom is what's up for trade,

369
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:59,117
then Destiny's as good as slayed.

370
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,575
You haven't won, Merlin. This isn't over.

371
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,858
I swear it.

372
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:52,941
Release me, Merlin, from your care.

373
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:56,695
My duty's done. 'Tis only fair.

374
00:38:56,775 --> 00:39:00,912
I'm afraid that's not possible,
friend Demon.

375
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:10,325
I apologize to both you and Jason Blood,

376
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:14,878
but your future portends a shared destiny.

377
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:22,304
Caught now, imprisoned in the form of man.

378
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:26,855
I fix the demon, Etrigan.

379
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:43,035
<i>It was also the beginning
of my eternal life sentence with Etrigan.</i>

380
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:49,932
I didn't think you'd give it up willingly,

381
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:55,086
and though this piece is useless without
the other half, it's far from powerless.

382
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,856
Safe enough where it is.

383
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:01,007
Displayed like a tourist trinket
in a Karachi bazaar?

384
00:40:02,424 --> 00:40:03,724
Neat, isn't it?

385
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:07,741
The House keeps my valuables out of phase,
so they don't go wondering off.

386
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:10,433
But, still, the timing
of the Stone's appearance and its power

387
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:13,188
indicates that it's somehow
involved with these crimes.

388
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:17,045
Which is why it stays here,
where only I can get to it.

389
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:19,434
I think me, them,
and everyone else who knows you

390
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:21,645
might want it to be somewhere else.

391
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,615
Your friend is awake.

392
00:40:27,649 --> 00:40:30,955
Ritchie, who was it? Who did this to you?

393
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,079
Faust.

394
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,494
Felix Faust. You sure?

395
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:51,910
There you are, you old bastard.

396
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,865
I give you wizard and asshole
extraordinaire, Felix Faust.

397
00:40:56,945 --> 00:41:01,218
Hell, I should have put it together.
Conjuring a whirlwind is just his style.

398
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:06,876
The League had a run-in with Faust,
but his location isn't in our database.

399
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:11,647
Yeah, wizards don't make a habit of
signing up for credit cards or social media.

400
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:13,993
His grandly named Observatory
of the Cosmos

401
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:17,636
is hidden from the likes of you
and Superman, but not from me.

402
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:23,374
Felix Faust.

403
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,075
- What's happening?
- If this were a computer,

404
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:37,789
I'd say it's frozen.

405
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:39,875
Cheers.

406
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:44,280
Felix Faust would take precautions
against locator spells.

407
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,916
There's another way,

408
00:41:45,996 --> 00:41:50,454
but it involves asking a favor of someone
that I don't have the best relationship with.

409
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:53,556
Someone else dislikes you? Shocking.

410
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:56,326
Your friend slips from the mortal plane.

411
00:41:56,406 --> 00:41:59,963
- John...
- Keep him alive and safe. Understand?

412
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:01,898
That is not my purpose.

413
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,201
I don't give a flying shag
what you think your bloody purpose is.

414
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:08,186
I order you to help him
any and every way you're able.

415
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:13,692
Let's go.

416
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:18,882
All right, I'll ask.

417
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:22,251
Why are we in the middle
of a godforsaken swamp?

418
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:26,022
It's a favorite hidey hole
of one Alec Holland,

419
00:42:26,102 --> 00:42:29,858
whose corpse was taken to be
the most recent Avatar of the Green.

420
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:32,028
Bet you won't find that
on your bloody cell phone.

421
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:35,409
Our data's more factual.
Alec Holland was murdered by terrorists.

422
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:38,368
His body was never recovered.
End of story.

423
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:40,253
Not quite.

424
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:47,527
Go away!

425
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:00,391
Swamp Thing!

426
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:04,878
I know you're seeing this.
Get out here, or the posies get it!

427
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:20,326
John Constantine.

428
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:24,897
You dare threaten the green.

429
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,424
Dude, your social skills are horrendous.

430
00:43:34,204 --> 00:43:38,446
Please, we aren't here to harm
any plants, but our need is urgent.

431
00:43:38,526 --> 00:43:41,917
Don't let your feelings for John
stop you from doing what's right.

432
00:43:45,816 --> 00:43:48,738
You have a garden.

433
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:52,202
Yes, I find it relaxing,

434
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:54,677
and I water it every week.

435
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:59,482
We need to find a man,
a wizard named Felix Faust.

436
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:04,153
A single human among your teeming masses.

437
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:09,142
I only know John Constantine
because he enrages me.

438
00:44:13,245 --> 00:44:16,001
Faust lives in an observatory
which is invisible.

439
00:44:16,081 --> 00:44:19,905
It's a place where dark magic
would infect the earth below it.

440
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:25,492
I will take you there
so you are no longer here.

441
00:44:39,437 --> 00:44:43,243
The place you seek is there.

442
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:58,224
That place is heavily warded.

443
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:05,933
I know we've had our differences,
but we could really use your help.

444
00:45:06,013 --> 00:45:10,154
If we don't get a handle on this rotter,
he'll threaten all of humanity.

445
00:45:11,136 --> 00:45:13,092
What of it?

446
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:16,911
You were once human, just like me.

447
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,498
No longer.

448
00:45:20,578 --> 00:45:23,867
Perhaps his actions are a kind of justice,

449
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:29,389
for who destroys more
of the green than your kind?

450
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,451
And Swamp Thing has left the building.

451
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:40,767
- Guess we do it the hard way.
- Or not.

452
00:45:40,847 --> 00:45:44,297
Gone, gone, the form of man.

453
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:48,476
Arise the demon Etrigan!

454
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:12,734
What...

455
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,292
- Who dares?
- I, Etrigan, bring down this house

456
00:46:20,372 --> 00:46:23,311
and build a tomb for Felix Faust!

457
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,403
As if I would stoop
to brawling with a demon.

458
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:33,921
Fight others of your filthy kind.

459
00:46:44,963 --> 00:46:49,386
From hell though we may be,
it does not make us family!

460
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:12,346
Do you like what I've done with the place?

461
00:47:12,426 --> 00:47:15,464
No woman can speak
in my sanctum sanctorum.

462
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:20,050
I conjured it just for you
and, of course, men everywhere.

463
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:37,692
As a fellow showman, this is no way
to treat your guests. Now, settle down!

464
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,982
Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting
yourself. Stop hitting yourself.

465
00:47:50,262 --> 00:47:53,467
Not everything can be solved
with your peashooter.

466
00:47:57,204 --> 00:48:02,712
Just because you're dead doesn't
mean you're beyond my retribution.

467
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:16,831
Is that it?

468
00:48:16,911 --> 00:48:21,796
Well, it's off to the old magicians home
for you, mate. Pudding night is Thursday.

469
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:36,597
Try that fireball once more, Constantine.
I'd love to see you cook your own goose.

470
00:48:36,677 --> 00:48:38,500
Let me...

471
00:48:58,532 --> 00:49:00,633
I take it back. That thing is useful.

472
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:44,398
Zatanna, where are you, darling?

473
00:49:44,478 --> 00:49:47,268
I know you can't speak,
but give me a wave.

474
00:49:47,348 --> 00:49:50,154
You're the only one here
that's really a threat.

475
00:49:57,125 --> 00:50:01,031
There you are. This will sting a bit.

476
00:50:23,517 --> 00:50:29,325
Stored magic? Really?
It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.

477
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:34,831
Here's what real magic looks like.

478
00:51:10,364 --> 00:51:11,801
Z!

479
00:51:49,104 --> 00:51:51,675
Z, are you daft? Stop!

480
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,764
I will kill you, woman!

481
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:28,500
Z, don't!

482
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,138
Don't kill him. You can't.

483
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,722
Out of my way, John.

484
00:52:36,802 --> 00:52:40,573
If no blood is spilled,
your soul is in the clear.

485
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,722
Get control, Z, just like I taught you.

486
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,709
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy. Deep breaths.

487
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,378
Let it go, love.

488
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,488
Do you see why I can't do what you do?

489
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:28,258
You lost control is all.
Happens to the best of us.

490
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,642
You've seen me in action, right?

491
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:35,114
Yeah, once or twice.

492
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:42,420
Why are you here? I haven't done anything
to warrant this kind of response.

493
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,042
This yours?

494
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,664
I don't know. Maybe.

495
00:53:47,744 --> 00:53:51,415
I have several hundred rings
of varying design and properties.

496
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:53,484
It isn't him.

497
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,954
Felix Faust isn't the one
behind the nightmare crimes.

498
00:53:57,034 --> 00:54:00,991
He summoned our old poker buddies
in their more massive forms.

499
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,592
The hell does it all mean?

500
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:06,346
It means Felix Faust had access
to the artifact whenever he wanted.

501
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:08,784
What artifact?

502
00:54:08,964 --> 00:54:10,920
Well, we're back to square one, then.

503
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,107
Unfortunately, no. We were sent here
by your friend, remember?

504
00:54:15,187 --> 00:54:18,859
- But Ritchie's dying.
- Is he?

505
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,920
Boy, boy. I think I got closer
to death than I planned.

506
00:54:49,517 --> 00:54:51,035
Bad girl.

507
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:55,580
See, now, you were told to do everything
to help me by the master of the House,

508
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,632
and that does not include punching.

509
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:02,736
Bring me to the main room.

510
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:10,276
I'll take it from here, beautiful.

511
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:14,432
But I need you out of my hair for now,

512
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:18,451
so why don't you just go
for a little walk?

513
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,081
Yeah! That's the stuff.

514
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:01,447
Why aren't we inside?

515
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:05,151
Because Ritchie's bloody well
taken control of the House.

516
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:09,637
This is what you get for having mates.
Boston, can you get inside?

517
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,129
That would be a no.

518
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:21,948
Ritchie, you're gonna listen to me
whether you like it or not.

519
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:26,119
Open the door.

520
00:56:26,952 --> 00:56:29,056
Do you hear? Open it!

521
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,265
Too late, Johnny Boy.

522
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:55,335
Ritchie, please!

523
00:56:55,615 --> 00:56:58,254
Stop while there's still time
to save your soul.

524
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:02,041
Says the man who skates
away from everything.

525
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:03,576
Since you got me infected,

526
00:57:03,656 --> 00:57:08,581
I've looked all around the world
for a cure and I've finally found it.

527
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:12,518
A small piece of the Dreamstone.
It's sentient.

528
00:57:12,598 --> 00:57:16,957
It told me how to get the Demons Three
to bring the rest of it to Earth.

529
00:57:17,637 --> 00:57:21,160
It would've been so easy
to take it from them.

530
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,565
Of course, rock star Johnny
screwed everything sideways.

531
00:57:26,045 --> 00:57:30,903
So we had to frame Faust
and get you to bring me here.

532
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:34,941
Now I'm immortal and supercharged!

533
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:38,845
You've been played for a sap.
The Stone isn't sentient.

534
00:57:38,925 --> 00:57:42,516
What's left of Destiny's soul was
whispering sweet nothings in your ear,

535
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:46,920
getting you to commit atrocities
to gain power and make his move.

536
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,189
You're just pissed 'cause I won.

537
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,640
I wish that were the case.

538
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:54,775
This can't be right.

539
00:57:57,042 --> 00:57:58,678
No!

540
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,653
Wait! Wait! We... we had a deal!

541
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:08,690
We had a deal!

542
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:22,636
Five hundred years, I've waited.

543
00:58:24,237 --> 00:58:26,609
Five hundred years, I've planned.

544
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:31,965
Really? I guess 500 must be the new 300.

545
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:34,736
What say we share
your beauty secrets over a pint?

546
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:38,153
A god does not prattle with mortals.

547
00:58:57,438 --> 00:59:01,129
- She gonna be okay?
- I... I don't know.

548
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:04,231
The amount of magic she's used,

549
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:06,715
sometimes you don't recover.

550
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:13,907
I should have never led her back.

551
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:15,642
Selfish bastard, I am.

552
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:19,325
You've done what you can for now,
but we have to stop Destiny,

553
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:21,515
or everyone's at risk.

554
00:59:21,595 --> 00:59:26,519
He's right. He'll have this city by midnight,
the Eastern Seaboard by dawn.

555
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:30,057
Then, what's to stop him? He'll be a god.

556
00:59:30,137 --> 00:59:32,845
We don't need another one
of those mucking about.

557
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,110
All right.

558
01:00:14,483 --> 01:00:16,104
Get 'em!

559
01:00:16,384 --> 01:00:19,273
They're everywhere! Everywhere!

560
01:00:19,353 --> 01:00:21,176
Yes.

561
01:00:21,656 --> 01:00:23,545
Yes.

562
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:25,426
<i>My will be done.</i>

563
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:34,455
Fool! How can you hope to defeat a god?

564
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:38,393
Not only can I sense you,
you cannot defeat my shield.

565
01:00:38,473 --> 01:00:41,512
Since when does God need a force shield?

566
01:00:52,888 --> 01:00:54,909
The Justice League are on their way.

567
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:56,944
Suppose that couldn't be helped,

568
01:00:57,024 --> 01:01:00,982
but make sure they stay well away
from Destiny, to not be struck mad,

569
01:01:01,062 --> 01:01:04,934
unless you want a bunch of crazed
super blokes ripping apart the city.

570
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:10,773
A little late for that, my friend.

571
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:29,659
<i>John, listen to me.
You've been affected by magic.</i>

572
01:01:32,095 --> 01:01:34,565
<i>Get away to space now.</i>

573
01:01:47,376 --> 01:01:49,298
Sorry to have to ask this, Jason.

574
01:01:49,378 --> 01:01:51,885
At least you're asking.

575
01:01:51,965 --> 01:01:54,787
Gone, gone, the form of man.

576
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:58,391
Rise the demon Etrigan!

577
01:01:59,021 --> 01:02:02,511
So Constantine calls once more.

578
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:05,048
Just like a greedy, wanton...

579
01:02:05,128 --> 01:02:07,117
Save the bloody rhymes, and top that git!

580
01:02:07,197 --> 01:02:09,267
Killjoy.

581
01:02:14,036 --> 01:02:17,361
I've had many years
to think about you, Etrigan.

582
01:02:28,383 --> 01:02:31,084
Call this poetic justice.

583
01:02:45,668 --> 01:02:47,672
Holy crap.

584
01:02:52,942 --> 01:02:55,698
Looks like you've finally
beat the curse, my boy.

585
01:02:55,778 --> 01:02:58,116
Wish it were under happier circumstances.

586
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:02,439
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help.

587
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:05,989
I just hope he doesn't realize
it's me doing the calling.

588
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:23,961
Who dares strike at me?

589
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:28,432
The Defender of the Green...

590
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:31,504
Swamp Thing.

591
01:03:50,967 --> 01:03:52,637
Perfect.

592
01:04:03,846 --> 01:04:06,564
Glad to see you
back on your feet, Zatanna.

593
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:16,562
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

594
01:05:04,508 --> 01:05:09,182
The so-called Guardian of the Green
who secretly hopes to be human again.

595
01:05:09,914 --> 01:05:12,684
Let me dispel you of that notion.

596
01:05:29,065 --> 01:05:31,270
Back to the dirt...

597
01:05:32,302 --> 01:05:34,508
where you belong.

598
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:49,107
He's getting more powerful by the second.
What the hell are we gonna do?

599
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:51,543
I say we go and talk
to a man about a horse.

600
01:05:51,623 --> 01:05:53,663
Did you hit your head or something?
You're babbling.

601
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:56,581
A Trojan horse, Boston. Come on!

602
01:05:59,363 --> 01:06:01,835
Over here, you wanker!

603
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,658
You are puny and disrespectful.

604
01:06:07,738 --> 01:06:10,376
Let me see your madness.

605
01:06:16,999 --> 01:06:19,821
Well, that's the trouble with someone
like me. Been there, done that.

606
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:23,275
I shall make you beg for death.

607
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,943
Can I beg you to stop talking?

608
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:29,081
I mean, all wizards are touched,
but you, you're a full-blown nutter.

609
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:33,051
I will tear your soul apart.

610
01:06:33,131 --> 01:06:35,687
And what happened
to not prattling with mortals?

611
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:38,839
You chatter like my grandma
at a book club.

612
01:06:39,772 --> 01:06:41,692
Now, Boston!

613
01:06:41,772 --> 01:06:44,047
Trick or treat, freak!

614
01:07:03,161 --> 01:07:06,467
Is that a sword in your chest,
or are you just glad to see me?

615
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,589
Merlin sends his regards.

616
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:13,408
And by the way, you lose.

617
01:07:34,427 --> 01:07:36,664
I don't think so.

618
01:07:54,915 --> 01:07:58,269
Johnny, I was... I was under a compulsion.

619
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:02,943
You've got to save me.
You owe me. You owe me!

620
01:08:03,123 --> 01:08:07,896
Sorry, mate. Can't take the chance
that Destiny is still pulling your strings.

621
01:08:09,261 --> 01:08:12,269
John, please! Help me!

622
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:22,228
Help me, you bastard!

623
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,947
Help me!

624
01:08:26,512 --> 01:08:28,735
That was unpleasant.

625
01:08:29,215 --> 01:08:31,238
What the hell did I miss?

626
01:08:31,318 --> 01:08:34,191
Z, you're okay. I thought...

627
01:08:34,271 --> 01:08:37,476
My head feels like
the morning after Brixton.

628
01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:40,896
Surely not that bad.

629
01:08:41,761 --> 01:08:45,653
So Merlin's spell hath ended.

630
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:47,688
It would seem so.

631
01:08:47,768 --> 01:08:51,640
Though it's a "good news,
bad news" sort of thing.

632
01:09:02,716 --> 01:09:05,738
- What's going on?
- Yeah. He wasn't wounded.

633
01:09:05,818 --> 01:09:10,325
Unless I miss my guess, that happened
on the day he was bound to Etrigan.

634
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,214
And now that I'm not...

635
01:09:14,294 --> 01:09:16,884
I'm truly sorry, Jason.

636
01:09:16,964 --> 01:09:21,003
Don't be. It's a welcome end.

637
01:09:32,513 --> 01:09:36,904
For 500 years, he and I have been bound.

638
01:09:36,984 --> 01:09:41,340
A demon from hell, a knight of renown.

639
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:45,178
Though we were cursed
to be slaves to each other,

640
01:09:45,258 --> 01:09:49,450
I know of no man
I'd want more for a brother.

641
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:51,808
Farewell, mortal.

642
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:09,371
You couldn't have picked a better place.

643
01:10:09,651 --> 01:10:12,206
The village where he was born
was over there.

644
01:10:12,286 --> 01:10:14,657
Too bad it took this to get him home.

645
01:10:16,124 --> 01:10:19,329
Batman asked me to be
in the Justice League.

646
01:10:19,711 --> 01:10:20,865
And you're considering it?

647
01:10:20,945 --> 01:10:23,952
I visited their headquarters
a few days ago.

648
01:10:24,032 --> 01:10:26,720
It's interesting, and like you said,

649
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,257
maybe it's time to make a difference.

650
01:10:29,737 --> 01:10:31,595
Listening to me now?

651
01:10:31,905 --> 01:10:34,076
They want you, too.

652
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:39,015
Good one, Z. Too right, they do.

653
01:10:41,615 --> 01:10:43,748
You have got to be bloody kidding.

654
01:10:43,828 --> 01:10:46,542
No way. Batty would go mental.

655
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:48,727
He was the one who asked,

656
01:10:48,807 --> 01:10:51,711
and I told him that's what you'd say.

657
01:10:54,094 --> 01:10:55,931
Be safe, John.

658
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:11,332
Now, hold on. Hold on.

659
01:11:11,412 --> 01:11:13,367
Maybe I've been a bit rash.

660
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:15,852
Could you tell me more over a drink?

661
01:11:16,885 --> 01:11:19,674
We could rechristen the House, as it were.

662
01:11:20,121 --> 01:11:23,657
- A drink?
- Yeah, a drink.

663
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:31,219
Don't think this is gonna turn into
some sort of Manchester weekend.

664
01:11:31,299 --> 01:11:33,689
Get that out of your head.

665
01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:36,659
We could have a Trewhiddle Tuesday.

666
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:41,545
- No, definitely not.
- Well, let's mark that as a maybe.

667
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:03,367
Now, that's what I call
making yourself useful, love.

668
01:12:04,305 --> 01:12:10,265
