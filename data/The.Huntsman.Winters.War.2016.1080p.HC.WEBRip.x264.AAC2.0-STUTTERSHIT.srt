3
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:37,597
What does the Mirror show you?

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,233
What do you see?

5
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:48,487
An oft-told tale,

6
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:54,762
that of Snow White.

7
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:58,773
How she vanquished the evil Queen Ravenna,

8
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:03,046
and took her rightful place on the throne.

9
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:10,336
But there is another story,

10
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,684
one you have not yet seen.

11
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:20,650
One that comes long before
"happily ever after".

12
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:34,040
THE HUNTSMAN
WINTER'S WAR

13
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,435
A mere pawn?

14
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,320
A humble pawn can bring down kingdoms.

15
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:06,890
Stop distracting me.

16
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,788
Poor little pawn.
Mean old king.

17
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:19,108
So sad.

18
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,642
But the final say...

19
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,213
Well.

20
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:31,755
Queen, will have that.

21
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,865
Queen takes king.

22
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:04,554
And you thought
this was just a game.

23
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:35,274
With the Mirror at her command,

24
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,527
Ravenna was invincible.

25
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,407
She took her kingdom
as she had taken others before it.

26
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,620
and as she would take
others again,

27
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:59,491
with her sister, Freya, at her side

28
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:18,343
Is it love?
Truly?

29
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:22,138
It is love, truly.
Your move.

30
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:25,642
Why should I bother?
You always win.

31
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,093
You always let me win.

32
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:34,410
I suppose you are my weakness.

33
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:37,030
Very well.

34
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:42,230
Queen to Rook five.
Checkmate in three.

35
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:46,939
Learn from lost, Freya,
and your day will come.

36
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:51,310
Your possibilities will be endless
once the magic awakens in your heart.

37
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:52,595
It won't.

38
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,469
We both know it won't.
I'm not like you.

39
00:04:56,548 --> 00:05:00,055
All the women of our blood are gifted, Freya.

40
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,352
And in time...

41
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:05,366
 you will find the source of your power,
as I've found mine.

42
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:07,244
We'll see.

43
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:13,305
What?

44
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,788
You're carrying his child.

45
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,545
Oh.

46
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,540
You didn't know.

47
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:28,714
Well.

48
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,789
- He's promised to another.
- He does not love her.

49
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:36,066
Their engagement is sealed
and cannot be broken.

50
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:38,488
He will deny you.

51
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:41,904
And he will deny your daughter.

52
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,778
He will not.

53
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,149
Freya.

54
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:50,453
I'm not being cruel.

55
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,480
I simply wish to protect you.

56
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:58,108
You may be surprised
how things turn out.

57
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:01,070
You know much, Ravenna.

58
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,650
But you do not know all.

59
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,781
I'm afraid I do.

60
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:24,601
Freya did not believe her sister.

61
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:28,453
For love blinds even the clearest eye.

62
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,873
And when her daughter
was but a few weeks old,

63
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:36,412
Freya's trusting heart was rewarded at last.

64
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,331
Her lover had sent word.

65
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:48,931
He would defile his family and marry
Freya in secret in the royal garden.

66
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,672
They would gather their child

67
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:55,580
and flee the kingdom
to begin a life of their own.

68
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,159
Freya, don't.

69
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:47,423
I had no choice.

70
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:50,006
I had no choice, Freya.

71
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,481
NOOOOO...OOO !

72
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:17,421
Consumed by grief and anger,

73
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:23,745
Freya left his sister to seek a kingdom
of her own in the land far to the north.

74
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,271
There, the people would come
to fear her very name.

75
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:31,557
Burn it!
Kill them all!

76
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,936
For if she could not raise a child,

77
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:38,389
then in it's place
she would raise an army.

78
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,412
Come on, boy!

79
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:45,384
- No!
- No!

80
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:48,999
Eric!
Run!

81
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,204
Come on, you runt.

82
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:28,106
Freya turned the once
green farm lands of the North

83
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:31,507
into a frozen wasteland.

84
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:38,953
There she built her fortress,
and rule as the Ice Queen.

85
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,765
Charrets!

86
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:43,619
How lucky you are.

87
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:46,852
You're with me now.

88
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:50,618
And you will never know
this suffering again.

89
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:09,989
You are scared?

90
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,998
No.

91
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:15,191
Is it your father that you missed?

92
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:18,001
Your mother?

93
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:21,216
- Yes.
- Yes.

94
00:11:21,303 --> 00:11:23,312
Tell me your name.

95
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,730
Tull.

96
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:26,400
Tull.

97
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:37,115
Love is a lie.

98
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:42,972
It is a trick played by the cruel
on the foolish and the weak.

99
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:45,058
Cast it from your mind.

100
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:49,839
Never let it render you
frail of mind, or of will.

101
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:53,418
Because in my kingdom
there is but one law:

102
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:56,473
"Do not love."

103
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:04,339
It's a sin,
and I'll not forgive it.

104
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:09,954
Now, let's hear no more
of family and love.

105
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,692
Those illusions are beneath you.

106
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:15,138
I have freed you from them.

107
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:20,671
And in exchange for this precious gift,
I ask only one thing.

108
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,475
Your loyalty.

109
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:27,859
You will train.
You will harden.

110
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:31,483
You will become my elite,
my Huntsmen.

111
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:34,972
And nothing will ever, ever
destroy you.

112
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,543
Take it!

113
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:41,486
One. Two. Three.

114
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,500
Strike!

115
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,655
And so, children grew to be soldiers.

116
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,518
Becoming one with blade and arrow.

117
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:44,405
Prepare your bows!

118
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,730
Draw!

119
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:50,432
Release!

120
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:25,467
Guard.

121
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:32,801
The boy and the girl.

122
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,826
Who are they?
What are their names?

123
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:38,551
- Which?
- The best ones.

124
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:41,639
Eric and Sara, my queen.

125
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,408
Did I scare you?

126
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,292
Do you not know?

127
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:16,469
I never miss.

128
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:21,023
More Charrets!

129
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,553
The new children, sir.

130
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:36,688
It's about time.

131
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:41,214
Come on, kids. Come on,
hurry up, get out. Come on.

132
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:43,312
Come on.

133
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:45,647
Don't worry.

134
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:47,970
Out!

135
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:52,453
Come on.
Move, faster.

136
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:57,490
Pssst.

137
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:01,111
What are you doing in there?

138
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:05,853
I know who lives here.

139
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,457
She scares me.

140
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:10,035
Uh, you're right.

141
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:14,247
She can be wee bit grumpy
from time to time.

142
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,372
Do you know what I do? I just never
let her know what I am thinking.

143
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:18,657
How do you do that?

144
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:20,926
Well, can you make a mean face?

145
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,797
That's not bad.

146
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:25,783
What about like this.

147
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,663
That's better.
Now, that's your war face.

148
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,836
If you wear that always
when the Queen is near,

149
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:35,394
she'll never know what
you're thinking either.

150
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:37,540
You do that and you'll be fine.

151
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:38,991
Come on.

152
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,978
The Queen sent her army to wage war
against the great kings of the North.

153
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:10,034
Battle after battle,
they returned victorious.

154
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:13,310
Those who were left alive.

155
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,712
You've done well, my children.

156
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,911
Very well.

157
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:30,309
You forget to walk in shadow.

158
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:38,367
And you forget your balance.

159
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:39,874
What are you doing?

160
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:42,870
Well, can't you tell, you daft boy?

161
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,197
I'm marrying you.

162
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,191
It was my mother's.

163
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:01,777
My only treasure.

164
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:05,644
I lived for her.

165
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:08,120
Now...

166
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:11,120
I live for you.

167
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:15,056
How do we live for each other
in this place here?

168
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:18,509
Freya will take one look at us
and she'll know, what then?

169
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,890
It's almost day.

170
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:23,637
Gather your things.

171
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:25,566
Meet me in the courtyard.

172
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,044
She'll catch us,
or she won't.

173
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:31,985
But either way...

174
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:35,680
we shall be free.

175
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:38,981
You do love me, don't you?

176
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,082
Aye, I do.

177
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,252
I give you my life and my death.

178
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:50,267
Stand or fall, I'll never leave your side,
I swear it to you.

179
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,351
I know this story.

180
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:42,948
The girl goes in secret
to meet her one true love.

181
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:48,285
I wonder how it ends this time.

182
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,094
I gave you both everything.

183
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:56,886
And in return,
you betray me.

184
00:21:58,586 --> 00:21:59,594
For love.

185
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:03,284
We fought your wars.
We've done enough.

186
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:05,278
Please, my Queen,
let us go.

187
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:07,816
Do not beg me.

188
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,372
It is weak.

189
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,246
You are weak.

190
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,549
You want to leave?

191
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,347
Very well, go to each other.

192
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:29,072
If you can,
and I'll let you go.

193
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,674
Shouldn't be too hard.

194
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,155
Love conquers all.

195
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:41,594
So I've heard.

196
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,796
Take him out of my sight.

197
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:35,006
Once upon a time,
a man and a woman fell in love.

198
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:38,132
But such things cannot last.

199
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:44,030
For the heart is a treacherous thing.

200
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:47,746
And love...

201
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,638
Love is nothing more
than a fairy tale.

202
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:02,001
Days turn to years.

203
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:04,653
Freya's empire continue to rise.

204
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:10,499
While her sister, Ravenna's fell at the hands
of the Huntsman and Snow White.

205
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,590
But some evil...

206
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:15,631
cannot truly be vanquished.

207
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:19,111
Seven Years Later...

208
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:21,925
Seven Years Later...
In The Kingdom Of Snow White.

209
00:26:57,893 --> 00:26:59,955
Fan out!

210
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,740
Align the flanks !

211
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:07,916
See you later, love.

212
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:18,611
- Your Majesty.
- Please, my friend.

213
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:20,686
How did you find me?

214
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:22,501
It wasn't easy.

215
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:25,503
Oh, Nion.

216
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:28,196
- You sworn.
- Well, he...

217
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:31,223
He friends put me in a big...
big pot.

218
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,670
What nonsense.
We paid him 3 gold.

219
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,697
3?
Is that all?

220
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:38,437
3 each.

221
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:40,147
- Who are you?
- Gryff.

222
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:41,631
At your service.

223
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:43,451
Bonds, rewards, debt collection.

224
00:27:43,476 --> 00:27:45,275
- I'm his brother.
- He, half brother.

225
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,083
- Same mom.
- Same mom.

226
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:49,906
Walk with me.

227
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:55,853
I have come on a matter
of grave importance.

228
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:58,591
Well, you should find some
gravely important people then.

229
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:01,516
The Mirror is gone.

230
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,439
We believed it's dark magic
died with Ravenna.

231
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:08,435
We were wrong.

232
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:12,927
There is an evil within the Mirror
that has only grown in power.

233
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:16,085
The Queen Snow White has vowed
to rid her kingdom of it

234
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,942
before it's darkness cannot be stopped.

235
00:28:20,813 --> 00:28:23,239
2 weeks ago, the Queen ordered
a detachment of soldiers

236
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:25,850
to take the Mirror to Sanctuary,
they never returned.

237
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,860
Wait, wait,
I'm not your man.

238
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:30,617
You're the best tracker
we have in the Kingdom.

239
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,011
As you say, the Mirror is evil,

240
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:33,729
it mustn't fallen into the hands
of the wrong person.

241
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,205
And Snow White thinks
I'm the one to find it?

242
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:38,944
She commands you
to find it.

243
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:43,471
And deliver it to Sanctuary where
it's wickedness can forever be contained.

244
00:28:44,726 --> 00:28:46,591
Do you accept or not?

245
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:49,218
Yes, yes, yes.
He accepts.

246
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:51,537
Provided, there's a reward.

247
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:53,933
I don't want no reward.

248
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:57,197
Eric.

249
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,469
Snow White is unwell.

250
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,415
The Mirror...

251
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,962
She said she couldn't stop looking at it.

252
00:29:05,987 --> 00:29:09,268
She can hear
it's voice calling for her.

253
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:12,529
That's why she sent it away.

254
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:34,337
What was that thing?

255
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:40,007
Move all your forces
to the northern border.

256
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:42,246
Why?
What do you know?

257
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:44,187
Freya, Queen of the North.

258
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:46,099
That owl was her spy.

259
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,663
Now, she knows about the Mirror.

260
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:51,192
And if she finds it, everything you
hold dear will be covered in ice.

261
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:53,313
Move your men to the north.

262
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:02,294
What are you two still doing here?

263
00:30:02,324 --> 00:30:03,865
We are your partners.

264
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,733
No, you are not.

265
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:08,103
I am Snow White's men as well.

266
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,738
I mean-I mean dwarf.
If she's in trouble, I want to help!

267
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:18,525
My Queen.

268
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,537
Vardhelm has fallen.

269
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:22,246
It was the last stronghold.

270
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:25,501
The entire White Lands
are yours.

271
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,299
You've won.

272
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:29,395
Have I?

273
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:38,425
The game is not finished.

274
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,154
Is this where the world ends?
Or is there more?

275
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:59,624
My Queen,
the South cannot be conquered.

276
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,791
Snow White's lands are too vast,
her armies are...

277
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:05,182
Did you know that Eric was alive?

278
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,389
Did you?

279
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:10,091
I...
How?

280
00:31:10,116 --> 00:31:13,266
- I swear to you I threw his body...
- That's alright.

281
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:15,606
I prefer it this way.

282
00:31:15,631 --> 00:31:18,416
There's something that he seeks.

283
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:20,881
I want it.

284
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:23,532
My sister's mirror.

285
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,790
It holds great power.

286
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:28,984
And with it in my command,
I can do great things.

287
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:31,772
I will free every child.

288
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:36,077
I'll save them all,
as I've saved you.

289
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:38,250
And my army of Huntsman will grow

290
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,361
until nothing will stand in it's path.

291
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:44,136
So, you see,
the game is not finished.

292
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,067
Prepare the Huntsmen.

293
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:58,385
- They came through here.
- Obviously.

294
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,535
It's to access to the Northern road.

295
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,217
Leads directly to Sanctuary.
No need to be a Huntsman to know that.

296
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:06,996
Hey, Nion,
who am I?

297
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,542
I'm talking to the dirt.
I hear it speak to me.

298
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:14,242
He's actually quite good at this, Gryff.

299
00:32:14,243 --> 00:32:16,401
He's stuff.
He's a buffoon.

300
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:18,194
We ride north.

301
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:20,606
Actually, they headed west.

302
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:24,347
The Northern road cuts through a plain
No where to take cover.

303
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:27,098
The Western road
runs next to a forest.

304
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:30,458
That's where they would have make camp.
That's where we're going to find them.

305
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:32,867
- Obviously...
- Shhh, shhh, shhhh.

306
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,773
- The dirt is talking to me again.
- What's it saying?

307
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:38,348
It's saying the mouthy one is an idiot.

308
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,736
He wouldn't last a day on his own
and should go home.

309
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,488
I agree.

310
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,850
I'm not going home
till I get my reward.

311
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,276
You want gold, but all you're going
to find out here is death.

312
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,541
A bit dramatic.

313
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,213
Dramatic, yeah, unless it's true.

314
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,908
We should consider it
an extra warning.

315
00:32:57,516 --> 00:33:00,388
I know I'm not afraid
of Freya of the Frost.

316
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:03,368
Hey, not so loud.
Keep your voice down.

317
00:33:03,976 --> 00:33:06,938
You're even more stupid than I thought.

318
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:56,046
Bloody hell.

319
00:33:56,071 --> 00:33:58,043
Who would have attack them
out here in the open?

320
00:33:58,068 --> 00:34:00,168
Keep your eyes peel.
They could still be around.

321
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:04,144
We'll look for tracks, blood trails,
anything.

322
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:42,117
Get off!

323
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:50,822
These are their own arrows.

324
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:53,000
Their own blades.

325
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:56,043
They killed each other.

326
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,647
But why?

327
00:34:57,648 --> 00:34:59,988
These are all the Queen's men.

328
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:19,798
The Mirror was here.

329
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,974
This is definitely not one of theirs.

330
00:35:36,897 --> 00:35:39,426
I grew up in the mines.

331
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:41,553
It's worth half the world.

332
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:45,362
Whoever it belongs to has the Mirror.

333
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,109
We need to find it
before Freya does.

334
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:00,516
What's this?

335
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:06,471
We have to get off the road.

336
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,562
I'm looking for... information.

337
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,971
You'll not get much for that.

338
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:19,830
Well, then.

339
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:22,398
There was a wee massacre
on the road not far from here.

340
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:24,257
The Queen soldiers.
You know anything about that?

341
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,109
Yeah, they passed through here
a few days ago.

342
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,343
- They did?
- They didn't stop. They weren't thirsty.

343
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:31,331
Was anyone...
anyone following them or...?

344
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:39,387
Oh, a pint as well.

345
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,682
I take that as a "No".

346
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:58,219
Good day.

347
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:08,881
A bit choosy for what she's offering.

348
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:11,283
Or perhaps you would have
better luck with your own kind.

349
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:13,453
Have you ever seen a female dwarf?

350
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:15,646
- No, I can't say I have.
- Horrifying.

351
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:17,598
Horrifying is the best of them.

352
00:37:17,623 --> 00:37:19,414
Repulsive things.

353
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:22,950
So, assuming this is a
commonly held opinion.

354
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,148
How exactly are new dwarfs made?

355
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:27,156
Uh, generally by accident.

356
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:28,793
Too little light.

357
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,376
- Too much of this.
- Yeah.

358
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:34,131
Come on, keep up.

359
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:39,037
Chilly with that door.

360
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,441
Pass me that.

361
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:43,401
- What?
- I'll have some of my own.

362
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,564
That.

363
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:47,456
You 3 looked like
you're far from home.

364
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:51,042
Aye, aye.
Just seeking shelter and moving on.

365
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,153
Are these your children?

366
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:54,861
Your missus must be
quite a looker.

367
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:55,999
- That's a good one.
- What?

368
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:57,679
- What did he say?
- Leave it aside.

369
00:37:57,704 --> 00:38:00,413
No, no, no.
I'm not having it.

370
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:03,077
You want to hold your tongue mate,
before you loose it.

371
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:04,323
Is that so?

372
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,187
Yeah, If it were just me own,
I wouldn't be worried.

373
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:09,884
If it's me and him,
I would be a tiny bit worried.

374
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:12,695
- Because he's a bit of a waster.
- Not true.

375
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,526
But none of that matters.

376
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,374
Because we are with him.

377
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:19,887
And he will gut you like a deer,
quicker than you can blink.

378
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:21,926
'Cos this man here...

379
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:24,327
This man is the Huntsman.

380
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:26,135
Is this true?

381
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,973
Are you the Huntsman?

382
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,747
That's me.

383
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,557
Well.

384
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:36,573
The thing is...

385
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:42,378
We are all Huntsman.

386
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:45,742
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

387
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:08,920
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait...

388
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:11,053
Can we not talk about this?

389
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:43,344
You call yourself a Huntsman?

390
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:48,288
I expected more from a man who had
the courage to betray his queen.

391
00:39:48,795 --> 00:39:50,428
And for what?

392
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:53,488
For the love of some spineless woman.

393
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,395
Maybe you were something
in your day, brother.

394
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,796
But that day is long gone.

395
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:11,645
Have you made your peace?

396
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,782
I'll be, soon enough.

397
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,313
Tell Freya I died a free man.

398
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:18,959
Freya doesn't care how you die.

399
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:22,363
No one cares.

400
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:25,536
You're already forgotten.

401
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,350
Fall back!
Fall back now!

402
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:52,323
You have aged.

403
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:55,074
Sara.
Sara?

404
00:41:58,772 --> 00:42:00,689
I tied you up.

405
00:42:00,714 --> 00:42:02,530
Is she his wife or something?

406
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:05,302
No, it can't be.
His wife's dead.

407
00:42:05,638 --> 00:42:06,898
Dead?

408
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,540
Is that what you told everyone?

409
00:42:11,144 --> 00:42:15,113
You poor heartbroken widower.

410
00:42:15,505 --> 00:42:19,345
That story must have wet
the eyes of many young lass.

411
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:22,096
Maybe more than their eyes.

412
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:25,359
No, no, no.
You're dead.

413
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,725
I saw you die.

414
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,784
This is not real.
It's not happening.

415
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:32,840
You're a ghost.

416
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:35,204
Or you're some...

417
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:38,502
Or some...
I'm dead.

418
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:40,298
Am I not alive?

419
00:42:40,323 --> 00:42:41,616
You're alive.

420
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:45,039
Although you should be dead.
You got hit on the head like six...

421
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,647
- What do you say, six or seven?
- Seven.

422
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:48,540
Seven times is a lot.

423
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:51,323
- So, this is...
- Real.

424
00:42:52,218 --> 00:42:53,851
Very!

425
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:01,084
Did you think I would forget?

426
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:05,760
Did you think I would forgive?

427
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:10,686
"Stand or fall", you said.

428
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:14,020
You'll never leave my side, you said.

429
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,195
You swore it.

430
00:43:19,587 --> 00:43:21,633
And then you fled.

431
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:25,047
I see you fight
and I see you run.

432
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:54,437
No, no, no, Sara.
That's not what happened.

433
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:56,523
I saw Tull killed you.

434
00:43:56,548 --> 00:43:59,108
I saw him killed you with my own eyes.
I would never leave you.

435
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:02,615
But I saw you leave me
with my own eyes.

436
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,550
And you of all people should know.

437
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:07,764
Tull could never kill me.

438
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:09,437
Sara.
I...

439
00:44:09,462 --> 00:44:11,304
- Don't.
- I swear to you.

440
00:44:11,305 --> 00:44:15,342
She put me in her dungeon
for 7 years.

441
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:19,271
And when I finally escape,
I swore I would find you.

442
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:21,453
It's taken me a long time.

443
00:44:23,766 --> 00:44:25,943
But here we are.

444
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,251
Husband...

445
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:31,639
and wife.

446
00:44:31,784 --> 00:44:34,226
You honestly believe that?

447
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:36,628
That I abandon you?

448
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:38,834
Aye.

449
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:46,915
You still forget your balance.

450
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:53,323
She's got another knife.

451
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:56,339
Yeah, yeah.
I probably should have said so.

452
00:44:56,977 --> 00:45:02,525
She's got 2 more little ones
in her left boot.

453
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,192
That's no longer important.

454
00:45:06,176 --> 00:45:09,996
If your face is the last thing
that I'm meant to see,

455
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:11,980
then I'm grateful.

456
00:45:14,894 --> 00:45:17,713
It should be the last thing you see.

457
00:45:22,612 --> 00:45:25,153
- I don't like her.
- No.

458
00:45:25,178 --> 00:45:27,249
I don't like her one little bit.

459
00:45:58,783 --> 00:46:00,418
My Queen.

460
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,029
No fire.

461
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:06,822
NO FIRE!

462
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:24,109
It's alright.

463
00:46:52,511 --> 00:46:53,931
So.

464
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:56,588
What happens if Freya
gets this Mirror?

465
00:46:58,056 --> 00:47:01,811
Don't you think that you and me,
have other things to discuss.

466
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:03,996
- Like us.
- No.

467
00:47:04,537 --> 00:47:06,402
What happens?

468
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:10,967
She'll be unstoppable.

469
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:21,132
- Where's my horse?
- I sent if off.

470
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:24,557
- Why would you do that for?
- Them horses make tracks.

471
00:47:24,582 --> 00:47:27,316
We keep off the road,
we'll be safe.

472
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:29,477
So, you're coming with me then?

473
00:47:29,502 --> 00:47:32,462
No, you're coming with me.

474
00:47:32,487 --> 00:47:35,363
Whatever you need to tell yourself,
that's fine.

475
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:39,051
From what I can see, your wee band
won't do too well without me.

476
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:40,148
Huh?

477
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:42,527
Whatever power this Mirror contains,

478
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:44,351
I'll not let Freya yield it.

479
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:47,731
We'll find it and we'll bring it
to the Sanctuary.

480
00:47:47,756 --> 00:47:51,959
And then you and I...
will part forever.

481
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:53,916
Now.

482
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,588
Tell me about this.

483
00:47:59,661 --> 00:48:01,979
We'll hit Callan Crossing by nightfall.

484
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,497
There's a market there,
they might have sold the Mirror.

485
00:48:04,522 --> 00:48:06,344
If an enemy uses diamonds for arrows

486
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,509
I doubt if he'll sell
the Mirror for money.

487
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:10,790
Well, if you don't like my plan,
you can piss off.

488
00:48:10,815 --> 00:48:12,979
Oh.
That is charming.

489
00:48:13,004 --> 00:48:15,471
And you can piss off too,
you so elegantly put it.

490
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:17,721
But that's not going to
get rid of me.

491
00:48:18,097 --> 00:48:19,889
You're still my wife.

492
00:48:23,183 --> 00:48:26,051
We...we were deceived.

493
00:48:26,176 --> 00:48:28,057
The ice wall that Freya
put between us,

494
00:48:28,082 --> 00:48:30,898
she showed us
what she wanted us to see.

495
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:36,846
Wait.
And what if I'm right?

496
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,128
Do we not deserve that chance?

497
00:48:40,153 --> 00:48:41,973
It wouldn't have matter.

498
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,054
You would leave again.

499
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:46,696
We blind ourselves to the truth
because we are weak,

500
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,553
because we hope.

501
00:48:48,578 --> 00:48:51,069
But there's no hope for love.

502
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:54,290
Love ends in betrayal.

503
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:56,336
Aye, and always.

504
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,509
Well, I don't believe you.

505
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:11,749
Don't move.
Don't move.

506
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:27,103
That looks familiar.

507
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:29,711
A dwarf made trap.
That's where I would have put it.

508
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:32,711
Yes.
It will take more than that,

509
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,364
to catch the like of US !!!

510
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,553
Oh, no!

511
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:44,160
Curse the bugger.

512
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,621
What?

513
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:52,082
It was unexpected.

514
00:49:52,107 --> 00:49:55,520
Oh. Oh what?
The hidden dwarf trap was unexpected?

515
00:49:56,506 --> 00:49:58,579
You're not the tracker
you think you are.

516
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:01,029
I've been a little distracted.

517
00:50:06,765 --> 00:50:09,485
Hey, Doreena,
we've got some of...

518
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,780
Catch of the day.
Catch of the day.

519
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:15,042
God, no.

520
00:50:15,965 --> 00:50:17,947
Careful, sweetheart.

521
00:50:17,972 --> 00:50:20,899
I wouldn't want to ruin that
pretty little face of yours.

522
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:23,418
Okay.

523
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,883
- Oh, boggle me.
- Oh, it's like that, is it?

524
00:50:28,908 --> 00:50:30,614
See, you don't even know us.

525
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,904
What do I need to know,
you squawk face little he-dwarfs?

526
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:35,930
The sight of you clods
make me sick.

527
00:50:35,955 --> 00:50:37,714
Shut your mouth, you monkey slag.

528
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:39,438
Shut yours, you grunty wanker.

529
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:41,462
Kiss my ass, you filthy minger.

530
00:50:41,487 --> 00:50:44,754
Kiss mine, you wobbly shed box.

531
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:47,292
- Sorry.
- Madam Dwarf,

532
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:48,737
we have no quarrel with you.

533
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:50,269
We seek a mirror.

534
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:51,766
I don't got no mirror.

535
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:53,141
Ho, ho, that's clear.

536
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:54,868
Right.
Oh, you are getting...

537
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:56,532
No, no, no!
Enough, enough, enough.

538
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:59,158
Well, just tell us what you want.

539
00:50:59,183 --> 00:51:02,950
Well, personally I like you to take
your shirt off and prance around me.

540
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:06,650
But since you're so modest,
I'll settle for every penny you got.

541
00:51:06,675 --> 00:51:08,513
Aye, so it's money you're after.

542
00:51:08,538 --> 00:51:10,341
My-My apologies.

543
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:14,059
All I have is this.

544
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,035
You know what this is?

545
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,130
It's a great big bullion diamond.
I'm not blind.

546
00:51:21,108 --> 00:51:24,751
- Where did you get that?
- You let us down and I'll tell you.

547
00:51:26,905 --> 00:51:28,281
Doreena!

548
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:30,436
Coming, Mrs. Bromwyn!

549
00:51:32,413 --> 00:51:34,578
Keep an eye on this lot.

550
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:37,256
Shoot the he-dwarfs
if they get mouthy.

551
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:38,231
Oh.

552
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:40,555
Or you just feel like it.

553
00:51:42,706 --> 00:51:44,409
- Hey, don't just cut it.
- Hey!

554
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,044
Whoooa!

555
00:51:53,547 --> 00:51:55,371
You... you thirsty?

556
00:51:55,396 --> 00:51:56,897
I could get you some water
if you like.

557
00:51:56,922 --> 00:51:58,659
Oh. Yes, thank you,
I like that a lot.

558
00:51:58,684 --> 00:52:00,016
Aw.
I mean, no.

559
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:02,589
I don't want nothing
from the lots of you.

560
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:05,368
Alright, my little fishes.

561
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:08,258
I have got a little proposition for you.

562
00:52:08,685 --> 00:52:11,189
- Truce?
- Truce?

563
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:13,676
When I get my hands
around your lice bitten neck...

564
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:16,045
Aye...
Yes. Truce.

565
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:20,689
Your diamond.
You got it from a golden spear, right?

566
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,342
Aye, I did.

567
00:52:24,426 --> 00:52:26,122
Goblins.

568
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:28,065
Goblins?

569
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:29,926
Goblins?

570
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:32,654
That old fishwives tale.

571
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:34,566
You expect us to believe that?

572
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:37,331
I expect you to stand there,
and look ugly and stupid,

573
00:52:37,356 --> 00:52:39,449
and say nothing else.

574
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:43,923
Goblins real.

575
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:45,572
Finest thieves in the world.

576
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:47,539
And greedy as the day is long.

577
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,555
- We're just trying to catch one.
- Yeah.

578
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,599
You know, they say their armor
is made of gold.

579
00:52:52,624 --> 00:52:55,228
- Where can we find them?
- Not far.

580
00:52:55,253 --> 00:52:57,621
There's a hidden forest
just up the Dorian river.

581
00:52:57,646 --> 00:52:59,583
On the Northwest side of the Sanctuary.

582
00:52:59,608 --> 00:53:01,910
They say they keep all their treasure
there in that wood.

583
00:53:01,943 --> 00:53:05,279
Gold, silver, jewels,
as far as the eye can see.

584
00:53:05,304 --> 00:53:08,275
If your Mirror's shiny,
it would be in there somewhere.

585
00:53:08,762 --> 00:53:11,338
Could we access the Sanctuary from there?

586
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:14,327
Don't know.
Maybe.

587
00:53:14,352 --> 00:53:16,404
Will you show us a way?

588
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:20,092
Well, you see, that's where
the proposition comes in.

589
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:23,936
You see, no one's ever
come out of them woods alive.

590
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:27,075
You two big one,
you look like Huntsman.

591
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,983
And Huntsmen are pretty handy
with the blade, yeah?

592
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:33,950
We all go in together.
You get your Mirror.

593
00:53:34,022 --> 00:53:37,888
Me and Doreena fill our pockets
with as much loot as we can carry.

594
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:40,634
Deal?

595
00:53:44,879 --> 00:53:46,586
Aye, deal.

596
00:53:48,608 --> 00:53:50,034
Right after I kill those two.

597
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:51,076
What? No.

598
00:53:51,101 --> 00:53:52,321
- What?
- Wait.

599
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:53,798
Why?

600
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:59,133
I don't know. I like them,
I guess.

601
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:02,838
Like the dwarf, do you?

602
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,416
So, Mrs. Bromwyn.

603
00:54:23,441 --> 00:54:25,831
Where is Mr. Bromwyn?

604
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,038
Dead, thank God.

605
00:54:28,483 --> 00:54:30,047
How did he die?

606
00:54:30,072 --> 00:54:32,526
Engorging his own eyes out?

607
00:54:33,255 --> 00:54:35,883
Keep flapping and gobble
and you'll find out.

608
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:41,276
I'm sorry about before.

609
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,639
I would have drunk your water.

610
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:46,644
You seemed thirsty.

611
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:48,925
Yeah, yeah I was.

612
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:53,750
I get thirsty sometimes.
If it's hot or if I'm running.

613
00:54:54,046 --> 00:54:55,704
- Me too!
- Ha.

614
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:58,727
Or sometimes if I eat
something really salty.

615
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:02,306
- Like roast chicken.
- Chicken.

616
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:15,523
I know why you're not talking.

617
00:55:15,548 --> 00:55:17,263
Do you?

618
00:55:17,624 --> 00:55:20,948
You noticed the sparks between
me and Ms. Bromwyn.

619
00:55:20,973 --> 00:55:23,133
I don't know what to say,
she's my type.

620
00:55:23,158 --> 00:55:25,202
Loud and angry.

621
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:27,432
Well, that's what I'm used to, isn't it?

622
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,585
And I'm awfully sure
you'll have a good life together.

623
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,464
Aye yeah, we would.

624
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:34,001
But there's a problem.

625
00:55:34,026 --> 00:55:35,926
Another woman.

626
00:55:35,927 --> 00:55:37,882
A bit taller,
not as pretty mind you.

627
00:55:37,907 --> 00:55:41,689
She sounds far too clever
 to waste her time with you.

628
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:43,730
I remember...

629
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:46,481
That one time we were
caught up in a net together.

630
00:55:46,506 --> 00:55:48,951
That was a long long time ago.

631
00:55:48,976 --> 00:55:51,733
Are you the only hero
of every story you tell?

632
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:54,155
Aye, that's because I'm very brave.

633
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,779
Which is why I'm going to
save you from drowning.

634
00:55:56,804 --> 00:55:58,776
And how do you expect...

635
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,985
That's some unpredictable waters around here.

636
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:05,839
It's not me.

637
00:56:06,747 --> 00:56:09,138
You're a real brute.

638
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:12,567
So are you.

639
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:22,574
We're here.

640
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:55,346
Oh.

641
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:57,954
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Come on.

642
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:27,352
What did you find?

643
00:57:27,765 --> 00:57:29,583
Flint and steel.

644
00:57:41,172 --> 00:57:43,733
Their blood smells like tar.

645
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,328
You see.
It is gold.

646
00:57:54,353 --> 00:57:56,095
Yeah, it is.

647
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:08,292
Goblins ain't real, aye?

648
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:18,601
Look.

649
00:58:32,661 --> 00:58:34,281
Do your best to stay dry.

650
00:58:34,306 --> 00:58:36,439
This is bonkers.

651
00:58:36,951 --> 00:58:40,078
Praise the bridge that carries you over.

652
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,579
More.

653
00:59:14,604 --> 00:59:15,782
Death.

654
00:59:15,807 --> 00:59:17,367
They killed each other.

655
00:59:17,392 --> 00:59:19,734
Just like the Queen's army.

656
00:59:31,627 --> 00:59:32,730
What now?

657
00:59:32,755 --> 00:59:35,177
Now we take what we came for.

658
00:59:36,236 --> 00:59:39,385
Keep it covered.
Do not look into it.

659
01:00:44,294 --> 01:00:45,854
Bollocks.

660
01:00:53,954 --> 01:00:55,968
The Mirror.
Move!

661
01:01:34,089 --> 01:01:36,154
- This is heavy.
- I can't see anything.

662
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:38,042
Ow, you're pushing me!

663
01:02:04,322 --> 01:02:05,882
Come on.
I can't see.

664
01:02:05,907 --> 01:02:08,752
What do you need to see?
I can see, I'm in the front.

665
01:02:08,922 --> 01:02:11,822
Aw, watch your feet.
Move to the side.

666
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:13,354
Lift up.

667
01:02:13,379 --> 01:02:14,530
Oh, this bridge is wobbly.

668
01:02:14,555 --> 01:02:17,479
It's obviously wobbly,
will you just shut up?

669
01:02:27,548 --> 01:02:29,052
See that?

670
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:47,643
I've never taken it off.

671
01:03:00,439 --> 01:03:02,266
It's time to go, love.

672
01:03:16,137 --> 01:03:17,511
Come on.

673
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,370
Go, go, go!

674
01:03:35,856 --> 01:03:38,140
Take the Mirror to the Sanctuary.

675
01:03:46,899 --> 01:03:48,691
Come on.

676
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:51,220
No.

677
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:19,778
I need fire!

678
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:21,235
Come on.

679
01:04:30,221 --> 01:04:31,926
Don't you miss.

680
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,800
I never miss.

681
01:05:09,288 --> 01:05:11,028
He saved us.

682
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:31,118
Eric.

683
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,065
Are you crying?

684
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:03,398
I can't rid ourselves
soon enough of that thing.

685
01:06:03,423 --> 01:06:05,344
The heart of the Sanctuary
is only 2 hours away.

686
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:07,860
I say we move tonight.

687
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:10,851
Aye, there will be a strong moon.
Plenty of light.

688
01:06:10,876 --> 01:06:12,363
No.

689
01:06:13,548 --> 01:06:15,575
Who knows what's lurking in the dark.

690
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,891
I agree.

691
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:19,557
Kid's stuff. There's nothing
out there that can take us.

692
01:06:19,582 --> 01:06:20,705
Yeah, that's right.

693
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:22,996
I took you, in a tavern.

694
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,253
I took you here as well.

695
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:29,697
In the morning then.

696
01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:32,112
Good night.

697
01:06:32,682 --> 01:06:34,298
And after the Sanctuary.

698
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,705
On to the Dwarf mining town.

699
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:39,759
Jewel and gold merchants
are looking to buy.

700
01:06:39,784 --> 01:06:42,778
Me and Doreena are going to make
an absolute killing.

701
01:06:43,786 --> 01:06:45,386
Where is she?

702
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:49,244
- Where is Doreena?
- And Nion?

703
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:51,288
Well.

704
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:54,105
Would you look at that.

705
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:01,321
Harpy.

706
01:07:01,703 --> 01:07:05,215
This one, is called Delphinium.

707
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,506
It's good for piles and toothache.

708
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:12,310
What's this one call?

709
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:15,928
That's just a flower.

710
01:07:16,927 --> 01:07:18,813
I think it's beautiful.

711
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:21,154
I think you are beautiful.

712
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:22,355
- Me?
- Yeah.

713
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,626
No.

714
01:07:45,884 --> 01:07:48,551
If you're looking for gratitude,
you have it.

715
01:07:49,497 --> 01:07:51,416
Nothing more.

716
01:07:54,822 --> 01:07:57,887
What exactly am I suppose to do?

717
01:07:58,315 --> 01:08:00,154
You think it's about you.

718
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:02,564
- No.
- What you should choose.

719
01:08:02,589 --> 01:08:04,737
What you should do.

720
01:08:04,754 --> 01:08:06,674
And I'm just waiting here
for the man to pass a test.

721
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:10,376
And you did,
so now I have to love you.

722
01:08:10,989 --> 01:08:13,180
But I don't.

723
01:08:13,898 --> 01:08:17,101
I choose for me.

724
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:18,929
Not you.

725
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:23,354
So let me go.

726
01:08:24,596 --> 01:08:26,711
I can't.
Stand or fall, I'll never leave.

727
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:29,233
Let me go!
Let me go.

728
01:08:29,258 --> 01:08:31,164
Sara, stop it.

729
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:33,734
The one you loved is dead.

730
01:08:34,469 --> 01:08:37,303
I don't even remember
what it feels like to be her.

731
01:08:37,328 --> 01:08:39,575
We did not ask for our sins.

732
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,060
We did not ask for this life.

733
01:08:41,085 --> 01:08:42,993
Eric, I've done...

734
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:45,374
terrible things.

735
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:50,009
Unforgivable things.

736
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:51,577
I know.

737
01:08:51,946 --> 01:08:53,720
So have I.

738
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:58,040
Maybe you and me are not
worthy of forgiveness.

739
01:08:58,065 --> 01:09:00,576
That's for someone else to judge.

740
01:09:01,024 --> 01:09:03,793
But we are worthy of each other.

741
01:10:06,825 --> 01:10:09,681
Eric...

742
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:13,846
Eric...

743
01:10:16,499 --> 01:10:20,322
Come...

744
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:23,453
closer...

745
01:10:24,312 --> 01:10:27,241
closer...

746
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,504
closer...

747
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:36,096
Kill...

748
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:46,017
Kill...

749
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:47,984
Kill...

750
01:10:48,438 --> 01:10:50,625
Yes...

751
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:53,721
Yes...
Yes...

752
01:10:55,798 --> 01:10:58,660
Kill for me.

753
01:10:58,685 --> 01:11:00,607
What are you doing?

754
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:06,478
Have you been true?

755
01:11:08,372 --> 01:11:09,459
Eric.

756
01:11:09,484 --> 01:11:12,486
My heart is yours,
it always has been.

757
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,693
But if this is a game...

758
01:11:17,714 --> 01:11:19,573
End it now.

759
01:11:20,405 --> 01:11:23,776
Have you been true?

760
01:12:18,947 --> 01:12:21,318
Huntsman, what is this?

761
01:12:21,806 --> 01:12:23,754
Stand tall, brother.

762
01:12:57,454 --> 01:12:59,054
Eric.

763
01:12:59,991 --> 01:13:01,835
My Eric.

764
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:05,375
Your Queen has missed you.

765
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:08,298
You're not my Queen, Freya.

766
01:13:08,694 --> 01:13:10,970
I'm forever your Queen.

767
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:13,731
Isn't that right, Sara?

768
01:13:14,364 --> 01:13:16,062
You see...

769
01:13:16,128 --> 01:13:18,622
You abandon her, Eric.

770
01:13:18,808 --> 01:13:20,701
But, not I.

771
01:13:21,754 --> 01:13:24,822
I raised her from despair.

772
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:28,856
Make her the point of my spear,
my tempered steel.

773
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:31,969
She's laid waste to kingdoms

774
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:36,102
and brought men such as you
to their knees.

775
01:13:36,461 --> 01:13:39,068
She's everything
that you're not.

776
01:13:39,072 --> 01:13:40,783
All I had to do is
sent her to you

777
01:13:40,808 --> 01:13:43,322
and you lead her
straight to the Mirror.

778
01:13:43,347 --> 01:13:45,368
It's pathetic.

779
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:48,726
Oh, what are these?

780
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:50,600
Dwarfs.

781
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:53,920
They are just like children.

782
01:13:53,945 --> 01:13:57,061
We're mighty far from children,
bitch Queen.

783
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:01,905
Adorable.

784
01:14:02,988 --> 01:14:04,068
Bring me the Mirror.

785
01:14:04,093 --> 01:14:06,377
You'll have to kill me first!

786
01:14:06,838 --> 01:14:08,340
No...

787
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:10,021
I won't.

788
01:14:12,384 --> 01:14:14,071
Doreena, no!

789
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,180
You knew. didn't you?

790
01:14:19,669 --> 01:14:23,116
You knew she would betray you.
And you spared her still.

791
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:33,942
Have you learned my lesson at last?

792
01:14:34,534 --> 01:14:36,655
Harden your heart, Queen of winter.

793
01:14:36,656 --> 01:14:40,239
Bury the world in a tomb of ice.
It matters not.

794
01:14:40,316 --> 01:14:42,284
Love will endure.

795
01:14:43,894 --> 01:14:45,839
Perhaps you're right.

796
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:49,299
Shall we find out?

797
01:14:56,615 --> 01:14:58,334
Kill him.

798
01:15:54,877 --> 01:15:56,619
Is he dead?

799
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,378
I think so.

800
01:15:58,612 --> 01:16:00,314
What do we do?

801
01:16:00,948 --> 01:16:02,469
Pull it out.

802
01:16:03,487 --> 01:16:04,928
Go on!

803
01:16:06,751 --> 01:16:08,606
One. Two.

804
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:10,131
Quickly!

805
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:17,054
Bloody hell, that hurt.

806
01:16:17,132 --> 01:16:19,182
I can't believe that she missed!

807
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,836
She never misses.

808
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,704
Have you lost your mind?

809
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,517
She betrayed us!

810
01:16:32,525 --> 01:16:35,267
Eric, she's not Cupid.

811
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:39,156
I doubt that an arrow to the chest
is an expression of her love.

812
01:16:39,181 --> 01:16:40,605
Oh, no, no.

813
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,020
There is a grand design
at work here, friends,

814
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,726
that grows even louder.

815
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:49,248
Head injury.
Number eight.

816
01:16:50,011 --> 01:16:52,618
She never misses.

817
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:02,821
Look, I'm twice as angry as you are.

818
01:17:02,857 --> 01:17:05,306
Doreena was the only friend
I had in this world.

819
01:17:05,309 --> 01:17:06,826
But you need to face facts.

820
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:09,287
Sara is not on your side.

821
01:17:09,312 --> 01:17:12,231
I don't need you
to believe what I believe.

822
01:17:12,528 --> 01:17:14,941
What are these for exactly?

823
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:19,147
I'll give you a hint.

824
01:17:19,172 --> 01:17:21,664
We're not going to
carry them on our backs.

825
01:17:21,794 --> 01:17:25,200
So what are you gonna do?
Trek all the way to the frozen north?

826
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:28,201
Face down an evil sorceress
and her entire army?

827
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:29,565
Aye.

828
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,117
All right, I'm in!

829
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:07,530
Tull, take the dwarfs to the gallery
and bring the Mirror to my sanctum.

830
01:18:12,196 --> 01:18:15,689
Welcome home, Sara.

831
01:18:39,937 --> 01:18:42,480
Freya...

832
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:46,703
Come to me...

833
01:18:51,107 --> 01:18:54,329
Say the words...

834
01:18:57,343 --> 01:19:00,783
Speak the words...

835
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:03,803
"The age can be wicked

836
01:19:03,828 --> 01:19:06,687
to those who walk alone.

837
01:19:07,696 --> 01:19:10,584
When I look into the mirror,

838
01:19:10,609 --> 01:19:14,167
I see myself as I might to become."

839
01:19:16,473 --> 01:19:18,737
Yes...

840
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:21,669
Yes...

841
01:19:22,994 --> 01:19:26,960
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,

842
01:19:26,985 --> 01:19:30,787
who is the fairest of them all.

843
01:20:49,924 --> 01:20:53,288
Do not back away from me.

844
01:20:53,775 --> 01:20:56,216
You asked a question.

845
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:58,807
The Mirror has answered.

846
01:20:58,832 --> 01:21:01,538
Ravenna, how?

847
01:21:01,563 --> 01:21:04,147
Are you not dead?

848
01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:05,793
Yes.

849
01:21:07,169 --> 01:21:08,669
No.

850
01:21:10,219 --> 01:21:13,766
Something in between.

851
01:21:15,274 --> 01:21:18,383
You've become quite literal, Freya.

852
01:21:18,757 --> 01:21:21,614
Of all people, you should know.

853
01:21:21,999 --> 01:21:25,883
That, is but a vessel.

854
01:21:26,868 --> 01:21:29,185
I left my body.

855
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:31,659
I went into the Mirror.

856
01:21:32,342 --> 01:21:34,578
And there I stayed.

857
01:21:35,506 --> 01:21:37,819
I became part of it.

858
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,102
Trapped.

859
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,238
Until you release me.

860
01:21:47,771 --> 01:21:50,940
We have much to do, little sister.

861
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:53,997
With you and your army
by my side.

862
01:21:54,022 --> 01:21:57,453
I will regain my kingdom once more.

863
01:21:57,986 --> 01:22:03,551
Snow White...
shall kneel before me.

864
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:09,408
She will beg for mercy.

865
01:22:10,236 --> 01:22:13,461
And then I'll tear her heart out.

866
01:22:18,372 --> 01:22:20,233
Ho.
That's...

867
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:22,839
That's a bit bigger than I imagined.

868
01:22:22,864 --> 01:22:24,798
So what's the plan?

869
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,701
You have got a plan?

870
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:30,109
Aye.

871
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:32,052
Is it any good?

872
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:33,576
No.

873
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:35,319
But it's simple.

874
01:22:35,344 --> 01:22:38,477
Freya will be in her Sanctum,
below the steeple.

875
01:22:38,502 --> 01:22:41,793
I'll make my way down from the top,
find her, and kill her.

876
01:22:41,834 --> 01:22:43,715
What about Nion and Doreena?

877
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:46,515
I have got someone on the inside
who is going to help me find them.

878
01:22:46,547 --> 01:22:48,948
- Uh, who?
- You.

879
01:22:50,187 --> 01:22:53,599
You have given my Huntsmen new orders.

880
01:22:54,693 --> 01:22:57,037
Better orders.

881
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,738
We will attack tomorrow
in 2 waves.

882
01:22:59,763 --> 01:23:03,460
Flanking maneuver.
I presumed you would agree.

883
01:23:03,485 --> 01:23:05,592
It's a far superior tactic.

884
01:23:05,617 --> 01:23:07,154
This is my kingdom.

885
01:23:07,179 --> 01:23:08,373
Did you say something?

886
01:23:08,398 --> 01:23:10,570
This is my kingdom!

887
01:23:11,312 --> 01:23:13,411
Of course it is.

888
01:23:14,486 --> 01:23:17,128
And it always will be.

889
01:23:17,317 --> 01:23:21,020
I would never question my sister's rule.

890
01:23:21,045 --> 01:23:24,805
But beyond these walls,

891
01:23:25,623 --> 01:23:28,069
is my kingdom.

892
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,307
My dominion.

893
01:23:34,492 --> 01:23:37,672
Do not forget what you owe me.

894
01:23:37,697 --> 01:23:40,802
I made you what you are.

895
01:23:46,132 --> 01:23:48,990
Come on.
Move along.

896
01:23:49,914 --> 01:23:51,721
Hurry and follow.

897
01:23:56,439 --> 01:23:58,414
Move along, hurry now.

898
01:23:59,516 --> 01:24:01,626
You, keep up.
Quickly.

899
01:24:02,502 --> 01:24:04,101
Shut it.

900
01:24:04,431 --> 01:24:06,891

901
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,479
Keep walking.

902
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:12,414
Just keep walking.

903
01:24:25,202 --> 01:24:27,593
It's not my sister's fault, my lord.

904
01:24:27,618 --> 01:24:31,555
She was hit in the face as a baby,
with a rock.

905
01:24:34,107 --> 01:24:36,011
You two, come with me.

906
01:24:57,234 --> 01:25:00,222
- Did you have to hit him so hard?
- Shut up.

907
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,540
It's very heavy.

908
01:25:10,899 --> 01:25:13,370
Right.
We stuff him in here.

909
01:25:13,395 --> 01:25:15,402
We cover our tracks.

910
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:27,132
That's very sloppy work, that is.

911
01:26:49,249 --> 01:26:51,868
This is the worst plan ever.

912
01:26:53,703 --> 01:26:55,584
My children.

913
01:26:57,302 --> 01:27:00,051
This is the day for which...

914
01:27:01,013 --> 01:27:03,423
For which you were born.

915
01:27:04,873 --> 01:27:08,175
You'll face an army of men
who have never lost a war.

916
01:27:08,206 --> 01:27:10,209
Men who have...

917
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,962
Who have forgotten...

918
01:27:18,465 --> 01:27:21,328
for what it means to be afraid.

919
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:25,114
We will bring fear...

920
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:28,415
once again... to Snow White's army.

921
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:32,240
And their lands will be mine,
and their children...

922
01:27:35,269 --> 01:27:37,166
Their children...

923
01:27:40,836 --> 01:27:43,177
For I am Queen.

924
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:47,544
I am the Queen.

925
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:51,547
This is what I trained you for.

926
01:27:51,586 --> 01:27:54,332
This is why I raised you.

927
01:27:58,044 --> 01:28:01,324
This is why I made you
what you are.

928
01:28:09,353 --> 01:28:11,997
Hello, Eric.

929
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:17,515
I've missed you.

930
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:28,999
Guard!

931
01:28:31,382 --> 01:28:33,032
Why?

932
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:36,063
Why?

933
01:28:36,129 --> 01:28:38,572
They're in love.

934
01:28:39,209 --> 01:28:41,673
They reek of it.

935
01:28:45,922 --> 01:28:49,389
Is this not your kingdom?

936
01:28:49,414 --> 01:28:51,022
It is.

937
01:28:51,047 --> 01:28:53,831
Do you not have laws?

938
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,721
I do.

939
01:28:59,622 --> 01:29:01,436
And what...

940
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:04,966
... is your judgment?

941
01:29:06,888 --> 01:29:08,537
Death.

942
01:29:29,716 --> 01:29:30,925
Traitors!

943
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,508
Traitors to who?

944
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:35,073
Your old queen?
Your new queen?

945
01:29:35,098 --> 01:29:37,551
- You broke the law.
- The law?

946
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,750
You've forgotten the ones
who loved you?

947
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:43,266
Your mothers, your fathers.
What law did they break?

948
01:29:43,291 --> 01:29:45,117
Love does not make you weak.

949
01:29:45,148 --> 01:29:47,441
It's all that ever give me strength.

950
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:50,018
Have we not fought side by side?

951
01:29:50,043 --> 01:29:51,789
We were children!

952
01:29:51,814 --> 01:29:54,898
Brothers and sisters,
do we not love each other?

953
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:56,065
Fight with me.

954
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,643
If you die,
die for something that's yours.

955
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,626
Why did you turn away, Freya?

956
01:30:14,651 --> 01:30:16,809
You deceived us,
and now you deceive yourself.

957
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:19,581
- Silence.
- Why didn't you kill us back then?

958
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:23,074
Instead you break my heart
and turn her against me.

959
01:30:53,261 --> 01:30:55,106
Pretty.

960
01:30:59,651 --> 01:31:02,064
You see, Huntsman.

961
01:31:02,895 --> 01:31:05,979
Love doesn't save your life.

962
01:31:06,382 --> 01:31:08,426
I should know.

963
01:31:13,366 --> 01:31:15,860
I've been dead before.

964
01:31:53,604 --> 01:31:55,305
I'm sorry.

965
01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:57,407
I'm so sorry.

966
01:31:58,445 --> 01:32:00,776
Stand or fall.

967
01:32:00,801 --> 01:32:02,521
Together.

968
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,654
- I stand with you.
- Aye.

969
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,547
- Aye.
- Aye.

970
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:26,586
Don't.

971
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:40,624
Stand back!

972
01:32:42,117 --> 01:32:45,192
Nothing can save you, Huntsman.

973
01:32:45,926 --> 01:32:49,127
All that's left is PAIN !

974
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:55,998
Ravenna, stop.
Stop!

975
01:33:01,226 --> 01:33:03,790
ENOUGH !

976
01:33:20,244 --> 01:33:22,242
We can't leave the Mirror.

977
01:33:22,267 --> 01:33:24,075
Then we climb.

978
01:33:25,338 --> 01:33:29,745
I thought I've driven
the weakness out of you.

979
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,858
I thought I made you strong.

980
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:37,221
But you're as pathetic
as you ever were.

981
01:33:50,139 --> 01:33:52,807
Have you lost your mind?

982
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:58,138
How did you make me strong?

983
01:33:59,459 --> 01:34:02,557
How did you draw the weakness out?

984
01:34:04,965 --> 01:34:06,812
What did you do?

985
01:34:09,218 --> 01:34:12,656
What did you DO?

986
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:19,104
I don't have to tell you anything.

987
01:34:19,129 --> 01:34:22,574
Oh.
Oh, but you do.

988
01:34:22,599 --> 01:34:23,921
You see, you said it yourself.

989
01:34:23,946 --> 01:34:27,448
You're something between
this world and the Mirror.

990
01:34:27,473 --> 01:34:29,743
I summoned you out.

991
01:34:29,768 --> 01:34:33,992
Now, you are bound to me!

992
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:36,584
Tell me the truth.

993
01:34:37,716 --> 01:34:42,339
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,

994
01:34:42,817 --> 01:34:46,825
Who is the fairest of them all?

995
01:34:46,962 --> 01:34:49,422
You are, my queen.

996
01:34:49,447 --> 01:34:51,470
But not for long.

997
01:34:51,495 --> 01:34:55,567
Your sister holds a baby
to her breast.

998
01:34:55,592 --> 01:34:57,405
A daughter.

999
01:34:57,430 --> 01:35:03,783
She will grow to be more beautiful
than even you.

1000
01:35:09,093 --> 01:35:12,030
You cannot ask such a thing of me.

1001
01:35:12,055 --> 01:35:14,401
I ask nothing.

1002
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:17,365
I am but a reflection.

1003
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:19,012
And you...

1004
01:35:19,037 --> 01:35:23,010
you have already decided.

1005
01:35:24,342 --> 01:35:26,537
Kill...

1006
01:35:27,977 --> 01:35:30,602
Kill...

1007
01:35:33,933 --> 01:35:37,683
Kill for me...

1008
01:35:53,591 --> 01:35:55,265
Oh.

1009
01:36:05,953 --> 01:36:08,096
I loved her.

1010
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:13,178
I loved you.

1011
01:36:20,884 --> 01:36:24,080
That's why I'm stronger than you!

1012
01:36:44,928 --> 01:36:47,977
Leave my children alone!

1013
01:37:53,815 --> 01:37:55,434
Sorry.

1014
01:37:55,927 --> 01:37:58,011
I'm sorry.

1015
01:37:58,631 --> 01:38:01,049
I killed your daughter.

1016
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:06,120
And released the greatest power
within you.

1017
01:38:06,145 --> 01:38:11,129
A power you have wasted
on nothing but cheap sentiment!

1018
01:38:12,366 --> 01:38:14,874
Did you not think
I wanted a child?

1019
01:38:14,899 --> 01:38:17,804
Did you not think
I wanted love?

1020
01:38:17,829 --> 01:38:20,056
But these things...

1021
01:38:20,081 --> 01:38:22,303
... were not meant for me.

1022
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:25,987
I have a higher calling!

1023
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:35,025
Do you still believe...

1024
01:38:35,306 --> 01:38:39,026
... that love conquers all?

1025
01:38:39,051 --> 01:38:41,063
Maybe not all.

1026
01:38:41,949 --> 01:38:43,616
Just you.

1027
01:38:44,146 --> 01:38:46,439
Are you ready, Huntsman?

1028
01:38:46,464 --> 01:38:47,815
Aye.

1029
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:34,395
NOOOOOOO !!!

1030
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:46,354
How lucky you are.

1031
01:41:00,724 --> 01:41:02,324
Come on.

1032
01:41:15,337 --> 01:41:18,617
Breathe.
Oh, breathe.

1033
01:41:23,224 --> 01:41:24,737
I'm alright.

1034
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,653
- Are you alright?
- Are you alright?

1035
01:41:31,678 --> 01:41:33,455
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1036
01:41:37,068 --> 01:41:38,847
Look, the sun!

1037
01:41:53,029 --> 01:41:57,736
Once upon a time,
there lived a beautiful queen,

1038
01:41:57,761 --> 01:42:01,504
who's heart was broken in two.

1039
01:42:05,102 --> 01:42:09,000
But even buried under ice and snow...

1040
01:42:09,988 --> 01:42:12,789
Love survives.

1041
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,745
- Not on your life.
- Fine. Fine. Fine.

1042
01:42:36,342 --> 01:42:38,420
You're going to give up that easily?

1043
01:42:40,393 --> 01:42:42,632
God, you're stupid.

1044
01:42:56,192 --> 01:42:58,788
The lands of the North were free.

1045
01:42:58,813 --> 01:43:03,180
And Snow White's kingdom
was safe from harm.

1046
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:10,467
And so,
some fairy tales do come true.

1047
01:43:10,492 --> 01:43:14,315
But none ever truly end.
