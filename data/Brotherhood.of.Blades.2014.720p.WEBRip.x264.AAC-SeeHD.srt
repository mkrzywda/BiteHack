00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:55,765
<i>During the 1620s, Wei Zhongxian, 
Head Eunuch and Head of the Imperial Assassins...</i>

4
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:58,824
<i>had been having his way in the Imperial
Court for eight years.</i>

5
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,825
<i>At that time, seven out of ten 
Court Officials...</i>

6
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:04,802
<i>were Wei's followers,
known as "the Eunuch's Clique".</i>

7
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:08,249
<i>When Emperor Chongzhen 
came into power,</i>

8
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,648
<i>he relieved Wei of all duties and sent
him to the remote outpost of Fengyang.</i>

9
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,305
<i>Although Wei had fallen, 
the Clique was still there.</i>

10
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:18,052
<i>Chongzhen wanted every member of 
the Clique arrested.</i>

11
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:21,192
It sure is cold, Master Ma.

12
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:23,049
A nice bowl of noodles would warm us up,

13
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,226
wouldn't it?

14
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:25,733
Noodles ...

15
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,847
at this hour,

16
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:30,187
only two kinds of people are outside...

17
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:31,781
besides the night watchmen.

18
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:33,485
There's us,

19
00:01:34,142 --> 00:01:35,683
sent by rotten luck...

20
00:01:35,683 --> 00:01:37,341
to patrol the grounds.

21
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,440
And then there's ...

22
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:43,926
What did you see?

23
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:50,265
Get out of there.

24
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:01,537
An Imperial Assassin!

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,669
What's wrong?

26
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:05,486
Lets get out of here. Come.

27
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:13,090
<i>[ The Imperial assassins are arresting 
the Eunuch Clique member Xu Xianchun. ]</i>

28
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:20,317
5 o'clock ... remember 5 o'clock.

29
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:22,478
Take Xianchun with you to Xizhimen,

30
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,403
and take this letter to Sir Cao.

31
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:26,974
You will leave the city in the water cart.

32
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:28,337
I'll remember that.

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,650
What is all this?
Why aren't you dressed properly?

34
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,697
Sister- in- law, what's the matter?

35
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:41,030
Sir Chen!

36
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,127
I'm from the North Zhenfu Division.

37
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,606
My name is Shen Lian.

38
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,349
Please don't be alarmed.
- I'm not alarmed!

39
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:55,212
Sir Shen,
even Imperial Assassins...

40
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,700
need an explanation...

41
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,342
for storming my residence.

42
00:02:58,342 --> 00:02:59,691
You know perfectly well...

43
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,437
why I'm here!

44
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:47,396
Sir Chen,
he only has one arm left.

45
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,227
Do you want him to keep it?

46
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,923
You know what I want.

47
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,484
Arrest me then.

48
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:02,461
I know your methods!

49
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,327
I can handle the tortures.

50
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:21,075
Leave my daughter alone ...
she's only 14!

51
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:24,462
Leave my daughter alone, she's only 14!

52
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,528
If she ends up as a courtesan
at the Academy,

53
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:32,279
it will be because ...
you harbored a member of the Clique.

54
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:42,460
Where is Xu Xianchun?
Tell me ...

55
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,060
and I'll leave.

56
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,947
Never to return!

57
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:03,983
Go!

58
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:21,527
Sir Chen,
if you do me a favor...

59
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:23,746
no one in your family gets hurt!

60
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,009
Sir Xu ...

61
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:41,787
please come with us.

62
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,598
Run Sir.
We'll take care of him.

63
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,304
Lui Jianxing,
I know why you're doing this ...

64
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:54,859
It's because I didn't promote you 
to the rank of Baihu.

65
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,191
Lui Jianxing, let me go!

66
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,236
If you do, I promise I'll promote you.

67
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:06,451
Lian!
- Yichuan.

68
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,019
Even Wei Zhongxian is down,

69
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,769
and this ex-Commander is still
so high and mighty.

70
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,504
Jianxing ...
the roots of the Clique run deep!

71
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,478
Those bastards higher up...

72
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:21,358
only remember the three of us...

73
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,672
when there is a tricky mission like this.

74
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:27,168
You're right,
but I'm afraid it's just our lot...

75
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:29,598
to deal with this kind of business.

76
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:37,485
Hey, Lian ...

77
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:40,880
Listen ...

78
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,757
I get it.

79
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:51,860
Yichuan ...

80
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,952
you can not go on like this forever.

81
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,566
<i>My good sir, it's getting late.</i>

82
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,220
<i>Why don't you come back tomorrow?</i>

83
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,412
<i>You bitch.
How dare you disrespect me!</i>

84
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,403
<i>Even if I have to pay double the price...</i>

85
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,663
<i>I will still bed Zhou Miaotong today!</i>

86
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:23,168
Come to bed.

87
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,923
I have to go to work soon.

88
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:31,556
You're an interesting character.

89
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,676
Of all our customers...

90
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,908
you're the only one who pays...

91
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:41,729
but doesn't come to bed.

92
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,199
I'm happy to sit here.

93
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,344
<i>Of all the houses ...
I picked yours tonight.</i>

94
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,089
<i>Have that Zhou girl cleaned up 
and see me.</i>

95
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:01,023
As soon as I've saved enough,
I'll buy your freedom!

96
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,119
Please, Mr. Officer ...

97
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,956
with your salary?

98
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:10,699
You're joking!

99
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:13,711
Besides, this is the brothel 
of the Academy.

100
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,302
Without an official permission ...

101
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:19,151
no one gets out!

102
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,203
Sir Chen, I need a favor.

103
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:24,998
I need you ...

104
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:27,450
to help me release a courtesan from 
the Academy.

105
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:37,189
It's morning already.
I have to go.

106
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,368
Next time, don't bother to change.

107
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,226
I thought you might not like the uniform.

108
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,692
Everybody here knows...

109
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:51,583
that you're Sir Shen of the 
Imperial Assassins.

110
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:21,961
Xiu!

111
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,543
What's the matter?

112
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:41,501
Afraid your officer friends might see me?

113
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:46,739
Don't worry, they're far away.

114
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,698
Xiu,

115
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:51,448
just take this...

116
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:53,097
and go!

117
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,963
It's better then nothing.

118
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:00,622
This is the last time,
I don't want to see you again.

119
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,189
You think this uniform turns you into
a respectable person?

120
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,407
A thief will always be a thief.

121
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,208
This secret of yours ...

122
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:11,921
will keep me well-fed forever.

123
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,657
Think I'm bluffing?

124
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:26,218
I'll give you three days ...
to get together 100 silver taels.

125
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,959
100 taels ...

126
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:30,173
I make 20 taels a year.

127
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:32,073
Where would I get a 100?

128
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:36,650
Go peddle your ass.

129
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,898
Quite a few high officials ...
who have a thing for pretty boys.

130
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,450
With your looks,

131
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,156
100 taels ...
would be a piece of cake.

132
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:09,663
Trying to kill me again?

133
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,671
I don't see what's so special about you...

134
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:18,297
that made Master favor you over me.

135
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,408
Three days ...

136
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,350
Sir.
- Lui Jianxing, you're quite an early bird.

137
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,269
I spent the night here after work yesterday.

138
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:41,829
And Sir Xui ...

139
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,801
Xui Xianchun is under custody?

140
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:46,471
Yes!

141
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,463
This is really thanks to your carefull
planning, Sir.

142
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:52,189
All the credit should go to you ...
as I wrote in my report.

143
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:54,127
Very well.

144
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,726
It's to early for any work.

145
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,241
Go get some rest.

146
00:13:02,017 --> 00:13:03,799
Anything else?
- Well ...

147
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,609
actually we talked about it already.

148
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:08,541
It's about my promotion.

149
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,014
I knew you wouldn't be here for no reason!

150
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:12,734
I still haven't heard back from anyone.

151
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:17,068
Sir ...
I gave you silver for the bribes.

152
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,337
I even gave you credit for last night!

153
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,358
Lui Jianxing, 
you have some bloody nerve!

154
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:24,817
In that case,
I want none of your credit...

155
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:28,041
and you can stop pestering me about 
this promotion. - Sir!

156
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:32,927
Apologies, sir.
I meant no offense. Please forgive me.

157
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:35,009
It's just that my mother keeps asking...

158
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:36,585
when I'll take over my father's position.

159
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:37,818
That's enough!

160
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,642
The silver you gave me...

161
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:41,303
only goes as far as Sir Qianhu.

162
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,799
Everyone needs to be bribed.

163
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:47,970
Either ...
bring me more silver,

164
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,000
or ...

165
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:51,657
learn to be patient.

166
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:09,617
Sir Zhao, - Sir Zhao ...

167
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:15,533
Which one is Lui Jianxing?

168
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,751
Do you know when Wei Zhongxian 
left the city?

169
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,322
Your Excellency, 
the day before yesterday.

170
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:28,979
If you leave now,

171
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,986
when can you catch up with him?

172
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,103
If the horses are fast,
in Fucheng County by midnight.

173
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,207
Good. You three, go do that!

174
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:47,447
Your Excellency?

175
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,469
His Majesty wants Wei Zhongxian dead.

176
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:58,818
Your Excellency,

177
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,663
why the three of us?

178
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,230
Look at how shabby you are.

179
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:09,380
There's no way you're part of the Clique.

180
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:14,340
Sir, Fucheng County is right ahead.

181
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,798
Once we're inside guard the four gates.

182
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:18,308
No one gets in or out.

183
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,087
Split into teams.
Inspect all Inns, big or small.

184
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:24,315
Get out!

185
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:25,920
How dare you throw us out!

186
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,365
Wei Zhongxian must be inside that Inn.

187
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,316
Don't send out the signal.

188
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:48,984
There's no way the three of us...

189
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:50,639
can handle this on our own!

190
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,940
With us three getting this mission...

191
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,890
plenty of people must be jealous.

192
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:56,688
Zhang Ying is not happy either.

193
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,968
He might have placed moles 
among our men.

194
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:00,648
If he wants to jeopardize this mission!

195
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:02,507
Even our lives are at risk!

196
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:03,753
Are you trying to make sure...

197
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,697
that we get all the credit for this one?

198
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,298
Think it through, I mean it!

199
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:12,523
Lian ...
are you not fed up with this life?

200
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,238
We have no silver and no connections.

201
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:16,667
What we need is an opportunity,
an opportunity...

202
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,238
to get on top!

203
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,665
Yichuan, what do you think?

204
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:33,158
It's so cold ...
Come sit by the fire.

205
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:37,109
You lowlives have got some guts...

206
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,942
making a scene here.

207
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:51,415
Kill them.
- Lady ...

208
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:52,853
they're Imperial Assassins!

209
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,804
Only three of them,
nothing to be scared of.

210
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,705
For each head ...
you get 10 taels of gold.

211
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:02,346
Give it a try!

212
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:05,126
Kill them.

213
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:18,953
Block the gate!

214
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,342
Get upstairs!
- Okay.

215
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,176
Sir Wei ...

216
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:45,799
Officer ...
even if you cut off my head,

217
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:50,138
you still have plenty to deal with.

218
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,641
What kind of trouble ...
could you possibly have?

219
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,058
Why does that boy Chongzhan
want to kill me?

220
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,778
Is it because I deserve to die?

221
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:08,413
You underestimate His majesty.

222
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:12,778
I was in power for eight years.

223
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,550
Now, my power is gone.

224
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,277
All that I have left is lots of money.

225
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,588
Bandits and Manchurians
are harrassing the borders.

226
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:22,221
What His Majesty needs is a fortune...

227
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,763
to fund his armies ...
and he has his eyes on mine!

228
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,872
If you don't bring him my money,
your trouble's only starting.

229
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,627
If we kill you,

230
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:41,604
we'll certainly bring back your money.

231
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:46,853
It isn't here.

232
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,680
400 taels of gold.

233
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:07,157
Open the door.

234
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:24,491
How much do you make a year?

235
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:26,817
A handful of this is worth...

236
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,843
30 years of your salary.

237
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:31,641
Let me live,
and it's all yours.

238
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:33,888
This money will get me killed.

239
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:35,784
If you kill me ...

240
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,685
my followers
will hunt you down one by one.

241
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:40,918
Don't even dream of saving your skins.

242
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:43,359
This money here ...

243
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,703
take it and you die.

244
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:46,677
Don't take it, you die aswell.

245
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:48,386
Why don't you take a change...

246
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:50,083
Sir Shen!

247
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:54,570
You know me?

248
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,443
I was head of the Secret Police,

249
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,359
we kept an eye on everyone!

250
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,692
From the commanders
to the petty officers.

251
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:05,952
I know every one of you.

252
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,842
Go, kill them.

253
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:18,748
Make a deal with me,
and I'll tell you where the money is.

254
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,917
Bring it back,
and your mission will be a succes.

255
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,514
<i>Lian! Lian!</i>

256
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:24,122
<i>Jianxing, watch out!</i>

257
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:26,376
Make up your mind.

258
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:29,244
Or your two friends want last much longer.

259
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:33,447
This ... all yours ...
all yours ...

260
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:42,742
Who sent you?

261
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,733
He's nothing but a pawn,

262
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:48,747
just like you.

263
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,451
Lady, it's on fire upstairs.
- Go upstairs!

264
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,658
Wei Zhongxian is dead.

265
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:07,458
The Eunuch is dead, drop your weapons!

266
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:36,448
Your Excellency.

267
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:38,531
Let me introduce the new Grand
Secretary of Cabinet.

268
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:39,871
Sir Han Kuang.

269
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:41,363
Greet him.

270
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,601
Sir Han.

271
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:52,867
So this is ...
Wei the Eunuch?

272
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,597
Yes, sir.
- Open it.

273
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:06,974
It's so badly burnt.
How do I know it's really him?

274
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,090
Here is his tablet.

275
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,548
How did he die?
- He set himself on fire.

276
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:21,098
Did you see him do it with your own eyes?
- Yes.

277
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:22,843
Then why didn't you stop him?

278
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,378
His Majesty wants the Eunuch himself,

279
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:32,156
and you brought back a pile of ashes.

280
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:35,040
This tablet is 
no evidence enough that it's him!

281
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:38,272
You don't even convince me,
let alone His Majesty.

282
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,470
Sir Han,

283
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:42,424
what are you saying?

284
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:44,288
You think...

285
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,031
these three Imperial Assassins...

286
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,422
brought back the corpse 
of someone else?

287
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,951
Sir, we would never dare.

288
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:07,584
If you ask me,
this is Wei himself.

289
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:11,604
Dozens of Assassins
saw him burning to death.

290
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:14,655
Who would have the guts...

291
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:17,463
to play tricks under everyone's nose?

292
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:19,363
It would have been suicidal.

293
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,739
Sir Zhao,

294
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,239
His Majesty is young ...

295
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,844
but very shrewd.

296
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:27,681
When you're at His service,

297
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,777
better be extra careful.

298
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:32,442
If anything goes wrong, 
we all go down.

299
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:36,576
Yes, Sir!
You're right, Sir Han.

300
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:39,515
Thank you for standing up for us.

301
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:41,227
We're more then grateful.

302
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,752
It's fine, go get some rest.

303
00:25:44,662 --> 00:25:46,859
Good job, 
I'll put in a good word for you.

304
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:49,214
Thank you, your Excellency.

305
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,838
But next time you see Sir Han,

306
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:52,239
don't be so presumptuous.

307
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,972
You know very well...

308
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:56,248
whether you really saw Wei or not.

309
00:25:56,683 --> 00:25:58,271
<i>Let's go.</i>

310
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:07,384
Your lungs are straining.

311
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:08,838
There's blood in your phlegm.

312
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:12,321
Your skin is dry and your pulse is weak.

313
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:14,221
Master Jin ...

314
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:15,813
how is your sleep?

315
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:26,139
Master Jin ...
- What?

316
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:28,810
I'm asking about your sleep.

317
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:31,763
I sweat a lot.
- I thought so.

318
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,095
Just a second, Master Jin.

319
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,670
I'll write you a prescription.

320
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:48,330
My name is Jin.
Jin Ychuan.

321
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:50,614
I know that.

322
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:52,711
Sweetie, 
if you're done with all the work...

323
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,285
come back in here.

324
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,285
Okay.

325
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,428
What is this?
- Musk, cloves, sandalwood...

326
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,839
and borneol wrapped together.

327
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,412
Keep it on you.

328
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:12,532
It will help with your cough.

329
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:17,450
Thank you.
- My name is Zhang Yan.

330
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,044
Don't tell my father.

331
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:21,511
He doesn't like it when I write
my own prescriptions.

332
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,176
Yichuan ...
- Okay!

333
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,326
Wei Ting, you've got some nerve.

334
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:05,692
The entire country is hunting down
members of the Clique,

335
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,893
and you dare return to the Capital.

336
00:28:08,182 --> 00:28:09,658
Jingzhong,

337
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,579
look at how you veil your accusations.

338
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:16,240
I see you've grown subtle.

339
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,598
Godfather ...

340
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,506
you're unharmed!

341
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:24,299
I'm not dead,

342
00:28:24,722 --> 00:28:27,179
and yet you don't seem surprised.

343
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:30,484
When I saw the corpse, 
I knew it wasn't you.

344
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,763
So of course I'm not surprised.

345
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:40,331
How are things at the Secret Police?

346
00:28:40,896 --> 00:28:42,525
His Majesty is having all documents...

347
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:44,438
at the Secret Service examined.

348
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:48,735
I think ...
he plans to close it up.

349
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:53,324
The Secret Police 
has existed for almost 200 years.

350
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:56,207
I didn't think it would end with my reign.

351
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,743
You're heading the Secret Police now,
aren't you?

352
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,940
You know everything.

353
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:08,281
His Majesty ...
just appointed me.

354
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:11,488
Special passes.
- Yes.

355
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:13,998
You would need them on your way.

356
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:16,700
You want to get rid of me.

357
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:18,609
That's not what I meant!

358
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:29,700
You recognized that corpse, 
didn't you?

359
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,323
It was my servant.

360
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:33,991
Ting found out that...

361
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:35,847
his family name was also Zhao,

362
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:37,850
and that you're from the same town.

363
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:41,437
Godfather ...

364
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:44,299
your men are no match for me.

365
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,973
If a fight starts...

366
00:29:46,144 --> 00:29:47,922
we both lose.

367
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,622
Don't you want to kill me?

368
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:01,607
I thought you'd be more reckless.

369
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:09,299
My son ...

370
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,276
you want to kill me...

371
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,978
because you don't want to get
dragged into this.

372
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,058
Am I right?

373
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:24,238
That Imperial Assassin knows I'm alive.

374
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,135
Kill him for me.

375
00:30:28,464 --> 00:30:29,785
Godfather ...

376
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:32,533
that Han Kuang is already suspicious.
If we act now...

377
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,931
I'm afraid he'll leave no stone unturned.

378
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:37,789
Kill Shen Lian,

379
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:41,603
and I'll disappear.

380
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:46,167
Only then,

381
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:49,084
will you be truly safe.

382
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,738
Miaotong ...

383
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:19,271
with this money ...

384
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:22,459
I can buy your freedom.

385
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:24,919
We'll go to Suzhou,

386
00:31:26,622 --> 00:31:28,697
and you can have whatever you like.

387
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:31,867
What do you say?

388
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:42,877
<i>Miaotong ... hurry.</i>

389
00:31:42,977 --> 00:31:44,748
<i>Sir Shen has been waiting down there.</i>

390
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,892
Madame, please offer him a few more drinks.

391
00:31:47,892 --> 00:31:49,308
My treat.

392
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:52,834
Miaotong ...

393
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:55,871
Why are you still here?

394
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:59,360
I have ... a visitor.

395
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,002
I can't bear to leave you.

396
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,224
Whatever visitor that is,
I'll ask him to leave.

397
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,946
That won't do,
he's an Imperial Assassin.

398
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:11,789
I hate their bunch ...

399
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:14,524
wearing Spring Blades bestowed 
by His Majesty,

400
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,936
but always with innocent blood 
on their hands.

401
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:19,836
<i>This one's different.</i>

402
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:21,857
<i>He says he will...</i>

403
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:23,789
<i>buy me freedom.</i>

404
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,375
You care about him.
- No, silly.

405
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:29,849
I'm not taking his money.

406
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:32,895
I only wish...

407
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,782
it was you who bought me freedom.

408
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,118
<i>Miaotong, I've almost saved enough...</i>

409
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:39,359
to take you away from here very soon.

410
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,408
We'll go somewhere beautiful...

411
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:43,017
and spend our life there.

412
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:10,273
You two are really too much.

413
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:11,998
Why are you still here?

414
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,470
Madame Xue,
I did pay you for this.

415
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,451
But ...

416
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:18,261
Alright.

417
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:19,932
You should go.

418
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:27,945
Miaotong, Sir Shen is gone!

419
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:35,837
<i>Miaotong, Sir Shen must never find 
out about you and young Master Yan.</i>

420
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,123
<i>You don't want to displease...</i>

421
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:40,231
<i>an Imperial Assassin.</i>

422
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:49,227
Yichuan, try it on.

423
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:56,329
Thank you.

424
00:33:58,129 --> 00:33:59,779
Lian is here.

425
00:34:01,503 --> 00:34:03,259
Lian.

426
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,346
Bottoms up.
- Cheers.

427
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:11,412
Did you go see Miss Zhou?

428
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:21,510
Yichuan, that pretty thing you 
have on your belt,

429
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,550
where did you get it?

430
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,405
Come on, Lian.

431
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,660
You were there, weren't you?

432
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,918
You little bastard, tell me.

433
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:32,741
Do you fancy the doctor's daughter?

434
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:34,279
You went to see the doctor?

435
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:35,770
What for?

436
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:55,889
Watch out!

437
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:07,387
Who were they?

438
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:09,622
Hard to tell.

439
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,324
Even on our way back here...

440
00:35:11,324 --> 00:35:12,764
we were being followed.

441
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:14,391
We should all watch out.

442
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:17,313
Maybe someone from the Clique 
wants to avenge Wei.

443
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:21,957
If so ...
we can't stay in the capital.

444
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,887
They see us but we don't see them.

445
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:27,767
Jianxing, 
why don't we ask our superior...

446
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:30,163
to transfer us to Nanjing?

447
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:33,472
Nanjing?

448
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:36,402
Lian, I've never seen you scared.

449
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,200
What's wrong this time?

450
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,178
Jianxing,

451
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,694
for once, listen to me.
Alright?

452
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:46,386
Wei Zhongxian...

453
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:48,598
set himself on fire?
- Yes.

454
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:50,178
He set himself on fire.

455
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,780
If you leave ...

456
00:35:52,912 --> 00:35:54,498
what about Miss Zhou?

457
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:56,289
I'll find a way to bring her along.

458
00:35:58,297 --> 00:35:59,658
You know very well...

459
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,473
whether you saw Wei or not.

460
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,309
I say ...

461
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:06,279
let's stay put, 
and see how it goes.

462
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:07,992
What do you think?

463
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:11,396
I'll do whatever you two decide.
- Good.

464
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,334
Jianxing ...
- Stop it.

465
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:37,873
I told you not to act on your own!

466
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:39,965
If it weren't for me...

467
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,616
they would have caught you.

468
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:43,963
Don't expect me to be grateful.

469
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:45,808
Godfather told you...

470
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,709
to do it as soon as possible.

471
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:55,626
I have my plans.

472
00:36:57,754 --> 00:36:59,698
Do you know about Yan Peiwei?

473
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:01,999
He's the Commander 
of the Imperial Court of Censors.

474
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:04,249
Correct!

475
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:06,450
He's also a member of the Golden Swords.

476
00:37:06,472 --> 00:37:08,662
Imperial Assassins ...
today...

477
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:10,697
you are to arrest members of the
Clique listed here!

478
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,679
He commands several dozen followers,

479
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,679
all highly skilled fighters.

480
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:17,359
Lui Jianxing!
- Yes, Sir.

481
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,166
Shen Lian!
- Yes, Sir.

482
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:20,818
You two come with me.

483
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,259
We're going to Yan Peiwei's residence.

484
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:26,650
When you kill,

485
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,501
it's essential not to leave any traces.

486
00:37:34,726 --> 00:37:36,438
Commander, we have been waiting 
a long time.

487
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:37,814
Shall we force our way in?

488
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:40,154
We're coming for Yan Peiwei alone.

489
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:42,886
Why storm the residence?
Is it a massacre you want?

490
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:47,168
Any volunteers to go get him?

491
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:49,140
Jianxing ...

492
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:50,928
something is not right!

493
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,856
Don't go!

494
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,821
What are you scared of?

495
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:58,601
Are the Golden Swords that scary?

496
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:00,644
Who would have the guts...

497
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,145
to resist Imperial Assassins?

498
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:03,790
I have orders.

499
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:05,867
Whoever captures Yan Peiwei...

500
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,216
will be promoted.

501
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,790
Lui Jianxing ...

502
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,724
wouldn't you...

503
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:20,309
like this credit?

504
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,766
You two don't have to go.

505
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:30,504
I'll go by myself.

506
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:47,409
Sir, how can I help you?

507
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:49,802
I am Garrison Officer Lui Jianxing.

508
00:38:49,904 --> 00:38:51,501
I'm here to see Sir Yan.

509
00:38:51,528 --> 00:38:53,480
I am Yan Junbin, son of Yan Peiwei.

510
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:55,703
My father is not well,

511
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:57,419
and does not want to receive visitors.

512
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:01,602
I have Division orders,
to bring Sir Yan in for questioning.

513
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,826
This is the mandate.

514
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:06,545
Young Master Yan,
it's better to let me in ...

515
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:09,766
instead of having the Baihu Commander
killing his way in!

516
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,680
What do you say?

517
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,917
Alright ...
please follow me.

518
00:39:37,597 --> 00:39:38,992
Having Imperial Assassins here...

519
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:40,270
makes them nervous!

520
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,836
Please don't be offended.

521
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:47,711
Father ...

522
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:56,657
Junbin, what are you doing?

523
00:39:56,657 --> 00:39:58,371
Father, I read the mandate.

524
00:39:58,371 --> 00:39:59,830
They're framing you to be 
a member of the Clique.

525
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,938
So what?

526
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:02,583
Even if I have to go to the highest court,

527
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,810
I'm still innocent.

528
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,118
What do I have to be scared of?

529
00:40:05,138 --> 00:40:07,490
Once you're in the Imperial Prison,
they will torture a confession out of you.

530
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,325
Why don't we tie up these Assassins...

531
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,266
and make a run for it?
- Shut up!

532
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,122
What you suggest is rebellion!
- Father!

533
00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:17,706
Sir Yan, we know you're not 
a member of the Clique.

534
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:19,703
It must be some kind of misunderstanding.

535
00:40:19,703 --> 00:40:21,897
I'm sure the judges will clear your name.

536
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:23,899
I do hope that...

537
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,851
you can come with us.

538
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:29,010
I'll come with you, but can you...

539
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,070
leave my family alone?
- Father!

540
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:33,680
By all means.

541
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,056
I won't be long.

542
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,678
Father!

543
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:44,198
Father!

544
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,617
Kill them!

545
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:56,758
Send the signal!

546
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,470
Commander, the fight seems to 
have started. Are we going in?

547
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:10,487
Are you telling me what to do?

548
00:41:11,056 --> 00:41:12,149
I would never.

549
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,632
No one goes in!
Seal off the gate.

550
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:17,620
Don't let any Clique member get out!

551
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:20,261
Wait till it dies down inside.

552
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,813
Open the gate!

553
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:36,455
Friends!
Open the gate!

554
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,917
Jianxing, the gate is sealed!

555
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,121
Everybody, stop!

556
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,243
Lian!

557
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:22,786
Jianxing!

558
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,745
Yichuan ...
- I'm here!

559
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:31,977
Lian ... - I'm here to!
- Let's finish this!

560
00:42:32,145 --> 00:42:33,864
And go get drunk.

561
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,816
Arrows!

562
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:58,579
Arrows!

563
00:43:03,768 --> 00:43:05,206
Your tea, Your Excellency.

564
00:43:08,508 --> 00:43:10,649
One Two ... One Two ...

565
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:23,067
Yichuan ...

566
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:35,372
What exactly ...

567
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:38,989
did we do?

568
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:57,904
Why are there no sounds?

569
00:44:58,059 --> 00:44:59,372
Open the gate!

570
00:45:34,674 --> 00:45:37,450
Your Excellency ...
the three of them are coming out!

571
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,440
Shit ... Goddamned!

572
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:21,303
Who is it?

573
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,670
Who's there?

574
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,023
Officer Shen,

575
00:46:42,148 --> 00:46:43,839
are you trying to scare me to death?

576
00:46:44,462 --> 00:46:45,902
I wouldn't dare!

577
00:46:47,183 --> 00:46:49,566
Especially ...
after I almost died myself.

578
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,525
It wasn't me!

579
00:46:54,204 --> 00:46:56,053
I didn't order for the gate to be sealed!

580
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:58,486
I don't know which bastard gave the order!

581
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,013
I told them ...
to open the gate.

582
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:04,291
Please, it wasn't me!
- I understand.

583
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,391
The three of us...

584
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:07,910
took care of Wei Zhongxian.

585
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:10,558
Obviously, the Clique wants us dead.

586
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:14,479
We can't stay in Beijing anymore.

587
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,005
Please ...

588
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:20,187
transfer us to Nanjing.

589
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,703
300 taels ...

590
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,275
Sure thing.

591
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,137
Once in Nanjing,

592
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:36,638
Jianxing would be promoted, 
I presume.

593
00:47:36,828 --> 00:47:38,303
Sure.

594
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:41,957
Shen Lian,

595
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,490
let's put this thing...

596
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,829
behind us.

597
00:47:49,134 --> 00:47:50,418
Shall we?

598
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:07,241
Sir Shen ...
my master asked me to deliver this.

599
00:48:32,348 --> 00:48:33,836
Father, have some tea.

600
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,006
Sir Jin, have some tea.

601
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:11,775
It's time.
I want the money.

602
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,231
A petty criminal killing an 
Imperial Assassin...

603
00:49:16,231 --> 00:49:18,095
and stealing his identity ...

604
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:19,747
I'm sure...

605
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:22,821
the police would be interested
in that story.

606
00:49:29,726 --> 00:49:31,122
100 taels ...

607
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:35,934
And leave Ynchuan alone!

608
00:49:36,568 --> 00:49:38,282
Take the money and get lost.

609
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:40,658
Didn't expect 
Sir Shen to be so well off.

610
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:44,900
Ding Xiu,
I did my homework on you.

611
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,765
You're an excellent swordsman,

612
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,818
but you're no match 
for an Imperial Assassin.

613
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:02,812
Thanks.

614
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,518
So you knew all along?
- Yichuan ...

615
00:50:11,753 --> 00:50:13,428
we're like brothers.

616
00:50:13,628 --> 00:50:15,245
I won't ask you about Ding Xiu.

617
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:16,682
In return...

618
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,221
please don't ask me...

619
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:19,709
about the money.

620
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:22,190
Deal?
- Sure.

621
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:27,251
Jianxing ...
Sir Han is throwing a dinner party.

622
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:28,777
We're all invited.

623
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:35,613
<i>Lian, 
you're hiding something from me.</i>

624
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,798
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

625
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,059
<i>Ever since we came back here...</i>

626
00:50:40,094 --> 00:50:41,926
<i>I know something is not right.</i>

627
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:45,474
<i>I've been wondering,
that night at the inn ...</i>

628
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,840
<i>what really happened?</i>

629
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:51,423
<i>Jianxing ...
I never betrayed you...</i>

630
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,946
<i>or Yichuan in any way.</i>

631
00:50:53,937 --> 00:50:55,388
<i>My conscience is clear.</i>

632
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:56,951
<i>I trust you.</i>

633
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,084
Sir Han is here!

634
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:12,020
Sir Han ... Sir Zhao.

635
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:15,381
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

636
00:51:18,592 --> 00:51:21,799
Officer Liu.
- Your Excellency.

637
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,409
Why are you hiding in the corner?
Come.

638
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:25,818
Sit here.

639
00:51:26,343 --> 00:51:28,506
Your Excellency,
I'm just a lowly officer.

640
00:51:29,027 --> 00:51:31,983
I don't deserve to share 
a table with you and Sir Zhao.

641
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:33,749
Nonsense.

642
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:36,151
It's your big day today.

643
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,004
You should sit here.

644
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:40,497
What big day?
I don't understand.

645
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,386
Officer Liu 
carried out His Majesty's orders...

646
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,191
and killed Wei Zhongxian.

647
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,981
That's his first feat.

648
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:50,248
Today he came out unscathed from
the Yan residence,

649
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:52,855
and captured Yan Peiwei's son alive.

650
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,698
That's his second feat.

651
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,876
Sir Zhenfu Commander,
what were you saying just now?

652
00:51:58,467 --> 00:51:59,731
Your Excellency,

653
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:01,315
Officer Lui should be promoted...

654
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,084
to Baihu Commander.

655
00:52:05,046 --> 00:52:06,432
Bring it over.

656
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:10,845
Congratulations, Sir Lui.

657
00:52:11,558 --> 00:52:14,539
Tomorrow you'll be a level 6 officer
of the Imperial Court.

658
00:52:15,038 --> 00:52:16,976
You are of course qualified 
for this table.

659
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:21,369
As you say, Your Excellency.

660
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:24,423
There was a funny story actually.

661
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,706
Sir Lui was so impatient that...

662
00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:29,409
he gave Zhang Ying 300 taels...

663
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:30,993
to bribe the right people.

664
00:52:30,993 --> 00:52:32,733
It was completely unnecessary.

665
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:44,782
Sir Lui ...

666
00:52:59,073 --> 00:53:00,571
Please don't be offended.

667
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:03,446
There are only good friends here tonight.

668
00:53:03,565 --> 00:53:05,539
Don't be embarrassed.
- Yes.

669
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,538
And don't go to Nanjing.

670
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,729
The Imperial Court needs people like you.

671
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,221
The three of you,
are better off here.

672
00:53:13,198 --> 00:53:14,551
Nanjing?

673
00:53:14,664 --> 00:53:16,650
Zhang Ying said you asked to be
transferred to Nanjing.

674
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:23,995
The food I serve is plain,

675
00:53:24,415 --> 00:53:26,813
so I'm showing a performance...

676
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:28,799
to add a little flavor.

677
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:53,210
By the way, Sir Lui...

678
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,973
where did you get the 300 taels...

679
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,465
for bribery?

680
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,756
Sir Lui,

681
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:08,543
you killed Wei Zhongxian,

682
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:10,910
and brought back tons of
his treasures.

683
00:54:12,242 --> 00:54:14,346
Sometimes Imperial Assassins...

684
00:54:14,446 --> 00:54:15,938
keep a little pocket money.

685
00:54:16,038 --> 00:54:18,066
I completely understand.

686
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,147
What I'm saying is...

687
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,462
you didn't need to spend that money.

688
00:54:23,823 --> 00:54:25,436
The position...

689
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,474
would be yours anyway.

690
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:34,955
In three days we'll perform an autopsy.

691
00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:37,998
If we prove the body is really Wei's,

692
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:40,717
His Majesty will announce to the world...

693
00:54:40,817 --> 00:54:43,878
that ...
the Clique has fallen.

694
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:49,218
And now ...
let's drink up.

695
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,551
Sir ...

696
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:11,528
with the condition it's in ...

697
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:13,814
it's still possible to examine the body?

698
00:55:17,015 --> 00:55:18,909
Wei drank elixir for so many years...

699
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:21,008
that we can still find it in his bones.

700
00:55:21,008 --> 00:55:23,878
This inspection is merely a formality.

701
00:55:27,129 --> 00:55:28,745
No need to worry.

702
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:31,224
You're right.

703
00:55:34,738 --> 00:55:36,329
Sir Lui,

704
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:38,773
you're getting promoted tomorrow,

705
00:55:38,773 --> 00:55:40,307
and yet you don't seem excited.

706
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,562
Anything on your mind?

707
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:46,587
No ... No.

708
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:48,613
I'm rather flattered.

709
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,313
Good.

710
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:15,489
What are you exactly,

711
00:56:15,564 --> 00:56:17,118
a good guy or a bad guy?

712
00:56:17,118 --> 00:56:18,711
I did it to stay alive.

713
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,264
What would you have done?

714
00:56:25,638 --> 00:56:27,122
I know...

715
00:56:27,122 --> 00:56:29,219
you guys made a fortune.

716
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:31,107
Give me half the money.

717
00:56:31,276 --> 00:56:34,130
Otherwise ...
I'll perform your story...

718
00:56:34,316 --> 00:56:37,509
every day in front of the Division office.

719
00:56:42,656 --> 00:56:44,079
Xiu ...

720
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:45,582
what fortune?

721
00:56:46,121 --> 00:56:47,749
There's no such thing.

722
00:56:53,658 --> 00:56:55,052
Sir Zhao.

723
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:57,610
You know who I am?

724
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,210
Who doesn't in this town?

725
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:24,992
Not bad.

726
00:57:26,536 --> 00:57:27,766
Your Excellency ...

727
00:57:27,766 --> 00:57:29,678
this flute is a family heirloom.

728
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:39,911
May I be excused?

729
00:57:52,548 --> 00:57:54,147
Jianxing.

730
00:57:58,878 --> 00:58:01,838
There's something that I've been ...
- Jianxing!

731
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:04,586
Tell me ...
- Jianxing, stop it!

732
00:58:04,586 --> 00:58:06,319
Why did you have to buy me a promotion?

733
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,158
Where did you get the silver?

734
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,592
Tell me ...
- You are my sworn brother,

735
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:13,577
and you set me up like this?

736
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:14,959
Tell me! Tell me!

737
00:58:15,464 --> 00:58:16,729
Jianxing, stop it!

738
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:19,109
Lian, tell him the truth!
- Go away!

739
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,799
Yichuan ... are you alright?

740
00:58:31,543 --> 00:58:33,222
Yichuan.
- I'm fine.

741
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,642
Wei Zhongxian is not dead!

742
00:58:51,383 --> 00:58:52,718
What?

743
00:58:58,892 --> 00:59:00,538
Every penny he gave me is here.

744
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:04,382
That's for Jianxing.

745
00:59:05,907 --> 00:59:07,326
That's for Yichuan.

746
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:09,824
And that's for Miaotong.

747
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,866
I didn't think...

748
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:13,658
it would turn out this way.

749
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:15,385
In that case,

750
00:59:15,408 --> 00:59:16,915
we were in so many trouble...

751
00:59:16,963 --> 00:59:19,010
because Wei Zhongxian wants to kill us.

752
00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:21,458
I'd like to borrow...

753
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:23,263
some of your guards,
if I may be so bold.

754
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,391
Zhao Jingzhong,
you already screwed it up.

755
00:59:25,738 --> 00:59:27,538
How dare you ask for Godfather's guards!

756
00:59:31,078 --> 00:59:32,641
Jianxing, Lian...

757
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:35,909
Sir Zhao is very likely the man in
black last night.

758
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,565
Han Kuang is performing an autopsy
in three days.

759
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,854
Those three have to be gone by the
day after tomorrow.

760
00:59:45,988 --> 00:59:48,218
Yichuan ...
don't say that unless you're sure.

761
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:49,718
I saw the arrow wound on his hand.

762
00:59:50,094 --> 00:59:51,641
Lian's crossbow arrow...

763
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:53,450
is different from anyone else's.

764
00:59:53,748 --> 00:59:56,221
I saw the shape 
of Sir Zhao's wound clearly.

765
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:01,227
Godfather,

766
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:04,249
within 24 hours,
I will have their heads for you.

767
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:07,865
Jingzhong,

768
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:10,526
you didn't expose yourself to them,

769
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,758
did you?

770
01:00:16,644 --> 01:00:18,501
Leave the country with me.

771
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:20,920
There is...

772
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,643
no place for you in the Capital anymore.

773
01:00:30,215 --> 01:00:31,979
Reluctant, aren't you?

774
01:00:34,012 --> 01:00:35,502
Yichuan,

775
01:00:35,504 --> 01:00:37,612
tie me up and take me to
the authority.

776
01:00:39,695 --> 01:00:41,230
It was my fault.

777
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:44,556
I can't get you two involved.

778
01:00:46,328 --> 01:00:47,800
The doctor's daughter is very nice.

779
01:00:48,047 --> 01:00:49,539
Treat her with care.

780
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:52,267
Those who rely on their luck...

781
01:00:52,787 --> 01:00:54,531
are gamblers,

782
01:00:55,223 --> 01:00:56,707
and you...

783
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:00,205
won't make a very good one.

784
01:01:02,922 --> 01:01:04,497
Godfather ...

785
01:01:09,027 --> 01:01:10,942
I am ready to try my luck.

786
01:01:23,398 --> 01:01:24,802
Jianxing,

787
01:01:27,626 --> 01:01:29,610
I only ask you to do one last
thing for me.

788
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,343
Buy Miaotong's freedom.

789
01:01:34,359 --> 01:01:35,739
Let's go!

790
01:01:35,978 --> 01:01:37,601
Let's leave town together.

791
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,069
Nobody needs to die.

792
01:01:44,278 --> 01:01:46,602
We'll live peacefully ...
somewhere else.

793
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:52,020
Yichuan, go pack your things.

794
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:54,575
We'll leave separately tomorrow.

795
01:02:00,197 --> 01:02:02,301
We have to be out of town
by nightfall.

796
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:20,462
Your Excellency.

797
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,092
You're a skilled fighter.

798
01:02:22,191 --> 01:02:24,228
I want you to kill someone for me.
- 200 taels.

799
01:02:30,505 --> 01:02:32,140
Here's 100, as an advance.

800
01:02:32,777 --> 01:02:34,344
Who does Your Excellency want to kill?

801
01:02:34,344 --> 01:02:36,134
An officer of the Zhanfu Division.

802
01:02:36,638 --> 01:02:38,390
Jin Yichuan.
- Who?

803
01:02:38,695 --> 01:02:41,062
Don't you know we studied with
the same master?

804
01:02:41,062 --> 01:02:42,612
People like you...

805
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:44,709
wouldn't care about that.

806
01:02:45,976 --> 01:02:47,304
That's not what I meant.

807
01:02:47,304 --> 01:02:51,641
That person is very dear to me,
like a brother.

808
01:02:54,158 --> 01:02:55,597
You need to pay more!

809
01:03:17,116 --> 01:03:20,706
I Monkey King,
will teach you a lesson.

810
01:03:43,346 --> 01:03:44,615
Miaotong!

811
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:50,396
The contents need 
to be changed regularly,

812
01:03:50,396 --> 01:03:51,985
or it won't work.

813
01:03:53,048 --> 01:03:54,594
Come here every three days,

814
01:03:54,678 --> 01:03:56,260
and I'll change it for you.

815
01:03:58,311 --> 01:04:00,450
I'm leaving town today.

816
01:04:26,557 --> 01:04:28,368
Are you here to see the doctor?

817
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:31,279
My father's out visiting a patient.
- That's okay.

818
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,787
I can wait.

819
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,038
It's for you.

820
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,664
The pardon letter from the 
Ministry of Penalty!

821
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,496
Where did you get this?

822
01:04:40,646 --> 01:04:42,922
I'm here today to set you free.

823
01:04:43,678 --> 01:04:45,128
I'm leaving town.

824
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:47,052
Come with me.

825
01:04:48,462 --> 01:04:50,655
That's your condition for giving
me my freedom?

826
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,070
I came here...

827
01:05:01,321 --> 01:05:02,961
to ask you a favor.

828
01:05:03,415 --> 01:05:05,170
There's an official in the name of Yan.

829
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,841
His son, Yan Junbin...

830
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,127
I heard is now in prison.
Can you get him out?

831
01:05:10,934 --> 01:05:12,587
Yan Junbin was captured by us.

832
01:05:13,216 --> 01:05:15,381
The three of us almost died
at their house.

833
01:05:15,926 --> 01:05:17,524
One of his hands ...

834
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:20,702
What happened to him?

835
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:24,471
Nothing!

836
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,457
I can give you money to make arrangements.

837
01:05:37,072 --> 01:05:38,653
Please get him out.

838
01:05:40,733 --> 01:05:42,465
You shouldn't squander your
money this way.

839
01:05:42,465 --> 01:05:44,629
It's my money,
I can decide what to do with it.

840
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:49,307
I never asked you for anything.

841
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:51,718
Just this once.

842
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:01,439
It's the Imperial Prison.

843
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:06,843
If you get him out ...

844
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:09,867
I'll come with you.

845
01:06:13,306 --> 01:06:14,920
When he reads this letter...

846
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,798
he'll trust you.

847
01:06:19,203 --> 01:06:21,231
Lian ... Lian ...

848
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:27,276
Is Miss Zhou coming with us?
- What time is it?

849
01:06:27,276 --> 01:06:28,798
Three.

850
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:30,756
Stay with Miss Zhou.

851
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:33,144
Where are you going?

852
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:34,943
The gates won't be closed for
another four hours.

853
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:36,771
I'll be back by then.

854
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,512
Listen ...

855
01:06:47,854 --> 01:06:49,599
I have many more bottles of drugs.

856
01:06:49,785 --> 01:06:52,417
Confess ...
and you won't need to suffer anymore.

857
01:06:53,641 --> 01:06:56,199
Stop wasting your time with him.
Finish the last few bottles...

858
01:06:56,288 --> 01:06:57,948
and we can go home.

859
01:07:01,012 --> 01:07:03,073
Officer ...
we have Commanders orders...

860
01:07:03,073 --> 01:07:04,878
to keep feeding him this drug.

861
01:07:05,536 --> 01:07:07,221
Take a walk.
- But ...

862
01:07:07,221 --> 01:07:08,720
You didn't see me.

863
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:13,838
Go, go, go.

864
01:07:17,448 --> 01:07:19,462
Sir Yan, I am Shen Lian ...

865
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:21,203
a friend of Miaotong's.

866
01:07:21,472 --> 01:07:23,689
She asked me to get you out of here.

867
01:07:24,192 --> 01:07:25,644
Miaotong ...

868
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,928
She wrote you a letter,

869
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:40,455
and asked me to bring it to you.

870
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,864
My eyes are gone.

871
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,144
Sir Shen, please ...

872
01:07:45,678 --> 01:07:47,339
read the letter to me.

873
01:07:47,987 --> 01:07:49,427
Will you?

874
01:07:58,061 --> 01:07:59,359
To Junbin ...

875
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,967
The wrongs that have been done to you...

876
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:02,789
will be righted someday.

877
01:08:02,924 --> 01:08:04,547
Please don't give up.

878
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,759
You once said that you'd take me
to a beautiful place.

879
01:08:09,149 --> 01:08:10,779
I'll be waiting for you.

880
01:08:15,702 --> 01:08:17,583
Let's get out of here.

881
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,546
Lian is back.

882
01:08:28,318 --> 01:08:30,632
Are you looking for Sir Shen?
He's not here.

883
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:32,746
I'm not looking for Sir Shen.

884
01:08:32,746 --> 01:08:35,641
A Sir asked me to deliver 
something to a Sir Jin.

885
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,210
Prepare my sedan.
We're going to the Imperial Hospital.

886
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:43,577
Yes, Sir.

887
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:46,497
Your Excellency, Sir Han has left 
for the Imperial Hospital.

888
01:08:46,597 --> 01:08:47,968
Yichuan ...

889
01:08:52,486 --> 01:08:53,872
There's still time.

890
01:08:54,386 --> 01:08:55,803
We can still make it!

891
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:22,597
Gentlemen...

892
01:09:22,597 --> 01:09:24,903
I need to make a trip to the
Division office tonight.

893
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,285
Would you care to join me?

894
01:09:28,078 --> 01:09:31,204
Sir Baihu, why do you need 
to go there tonight?

895
01:09:32,767 --> 01:09:34,218
To take my punishment.

896
01:09:34,318 --> 01:09:37,205
Tell Ting to do it.
- Yes, Sir.

897
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,542
Sir Shen.
- Where's Miaotong?

898
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:43,427
I'm here to buy her freedom.

899
01:09:48,905 --> 01:09:50,348
Doctor Zhang.

900
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,675
Doctor Zhang ...

901
01:10:30,129 --> 01:10:31,580
Let her go.

902
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:40,484
I'm aware that people say you
should never...

903
01:10:40,565 --> 01:10:42,099
kill doctors,

904
01:10:42,099 --> 01:10:43,692
but I had no choice.

905
01:10:43,692 --> 01:10:45,803
Someone paid a price for your head.

906
01:10:46,537 --> 01:10:48,197
A very high price.

907
01:10:49,398 --> 01:10:51,094
I plan to kill you anyway,

908
01:10:51,469 --> 01:10:53,368
so why not make some money?

909
01:10:53,368 --> 01:10:54,909
So let's not waste...

910
01:10:55,087 --> 01:10:56,657
any more time.

911
01:11:07,988 --> 01:11:09,603
You picked a good one.

912
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:11,522
This girl ...

913
01:11:13,267 --> 01:11:14,978
feels really good.

914
01:11:32,693 --> 01:11:34,314
Why aren't you packed?

915
01:11:37,825 --> 01:11:39,320
How is ...

916
01:11:39,355 --> 01:11:40,793
Sir Yan?

917
01:11:41,528 --> 01:11:43,508
No big deal.
You don't need to pack.

918
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:45,386
I'll buy you new things.

919
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:48,099
How is Sir Yan?

920
01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:53,566
Miaotong ...

921
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,867
I have bought you freedom.

922
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:57,953
We have to hurry.

923
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,926
The gates will be closed soon.

924
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,438
Where is Sir Yan?
What happened to him?

925
01:12:14,724 --> 01:12:16,562
I'm as good as dead.

926
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:19,973
I can't imagine what else they 
would do to me.

927
01:12:23,348 --> 01:12:24,963
You don't need to wait for him.

928
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:28,322
He's dead.

929
01:12:31,398 --> 01:12:32,705
I don't believe you!

930
01:12:32,705 --> 01:12:34,988
You're only saying that so I'd
come with you.

931
01:12:36,761 --> 01:12:38,239
I'm waiting for him.

932
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:42,763
I'm not lying.

933
01:12:45,706 --> 01:12:47,468
I have a huge favor to ask.

934
01:12:48,519 --> 01:12:51,206
Please kill me.
- I killed him.

935
01:12:52,628 --> 01:12:54,331
He begged me to.

936
01:12:58,743 --> 01:13:00,280
If you're dead ...

937
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,315
what am I supposed to say to her?

938
01:13:03,309 --> 01:13:04,869
You chopped off my hand.

939
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:09,125
Kill me ...
and we're even.

940
01:13:09,823 --> 01:13:11,446
You knew it was me?

941
01:13:21,706 --> 01:13:23,479
Tell Miaotong that ...

942
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:26,484
she doesn't need to wait for me.

943
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:31,185
We have to hurry.

944
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:46,667
We have a change only if we go now.

945
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,492
Miaotong ...

946
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:08,349
we must leave.

947
01:14:11,498 --> 01:14:13,107
I was 12 years old ...

948
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:17,781
when Imperial Assassins ransacked
our house.

949
01:14:20,991 --> 01:14:22,776
It was also them ...

950
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,704
who brought me to this place.

951
01:14:34,267 --> 01:14:36,455
Ever since the first time I saw you.

952
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:38,832
I've been scared of you.

953
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:41,468
I hated your uniform ...

954
01:14:42,414 --> 01:14:44,294
and that blade.

955
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:47,718
You think I like you?

956
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:49,800
I'm just scared of you.

957
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,894
I know ...

958
01:15:00,507 --> 01:15:02,393
you've been good to me,

959
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:05,898
better than anyone.

960
01:15:07,276 --> 01:15:09,078
But I just can't let it go.

961
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,886
I saw your face so clearly.

962
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:19,722
On the day my family was ransacked.

963
01:15:21,339 --> 01:15:22,849
I saw you.

964
01:15:23,959 --> 01:15:26,284
You arrested my father with
your own hands.

965
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:33,397
I don't know if I should hate you
or be grateful.

966
01:15:46,078 --> 01:15:48,099
Do you still want me to come with you?

967
01:15:50,388 --> 01:15:52,088
Sir Shen?

968
01:17:51,788 --> 01:17:53,417
Sir Han ...

969
01:17:54,287 --> 01:17:56,598
the bones are not right.
He's too young.

970
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:58,763
He can't be Wei Zhongxian.

971
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:16,649
Only when you're dead,
can Godfather live in peace.

972
01:18:17,297 --> 01:18:19,444
Run for your life,
when you still can.

973
01:18:28,723 --> 01:18:31,287
Lui Jianxing ...
you have deceived His Majesty!

974
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:32,823
Throw down your weapon.

975
01:18:35,067 --> 01:18:36,693
Kill them.

976
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:19,230
Miaotong.

977
01:19:19,815 --> 01:19:21,637
I'll take you to the doctor.

978
01:19:24,538 --> 01:19:25,904
Leave me alone.

979
01:19:26,281 --> 01:19:28,362
Jin Yichuan 
is at the Bailu Clinic.

980
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,176
Go find him.

981
01:19:45,137 --> 01:19:46,918
Why didn't you kill Wei Zhongxian?

982
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:49,446
I wanted to live.
- It seems you want to die instead.

983
01:19:50,078 --> 01:19:51,615
Your Excellency,

984
01:19:51,798 --> 01:19:53,518
you have exposed yourself.

985
01:19:53,518 --> 01:19:54,863
So what?

986
01:19:56,108 --> 01:19:57,884
If I kill you three...

987
01:19:58,402 --> 01:20:01,111
I'll still be Commander
of the Secret Police tomorrow.

988
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:41,174
You are so dead!
Not just you,

989
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:42,786
but this woman aswell.

990
01:22:23,543 --> 01:22:26,253
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency ...

991
01:22:27,448 --> 01:22:28,769
Your Excellency.

992
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:52,841
If it weren't for me ...

993
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,250
you wouldn't end up like this.

994
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,395
You will yourself cut like this.

995
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,852
Even if I have one breath left.

996
01:24:04,046 --> 01:24:05,745
I'm gonna kill you!

997
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,338
Those moves of yours...

998
01:24:21,469 --> 01:24:23,378
Master never taught me.

999
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:03,766
You're such a wreck.

1000
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:05,690
Going on would be boring.

1001
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:08,584
Consider our score settled today.

1002
01:25:12,991 --> 01:25:14,535
Don't hurt the girl.

1003
01:25:16,519 --> 01:25:18,321
Don't hurt the girl.

1004
01:25:23,992 --> 01:25:25,609
What if I tell you...

1005
01:25:26,606 --> 01:25:28,973
that all I ever did 
was kill her father,

1006
01:25:29,248 --> 01:25:31,303
and I never laid a finger on her!

1007
01:25:32,248 --> 01:25:33,814
Would you be happy?

1008
01:25:46,075 --> 01:25:47,520
This is the end.

1009
01:25:57,998 --> 01:25:59,734
But if I really kill you,

1010
01:26:02,487 --> 01:26:04,171
I'll be alone ...

1011
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:09,544
in this world.

1012
01:26:18,337 --> 01:26:19,885
Go away ...

1013
01:26:33,047 --> 01:26:34,518
Lui Jianxing?

1014
01:26:34,518 --> 01:26:36,209
I am Lui Jianxing.

1015
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,483
Your Honor.

1016
01:26:38,483 --> 01:26:41,196
Lui Jianxing ...
did you let go of Wei Zhongxian?

1017
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,949
Yes.
- Why?

1018
01:26:49,693 --> 01:26:51,290
So where is Wei...

1019
01:26:51,507 --> 01:26:53,161
at the moment?

1020
01:26:54,311 --> 01:26:55,732
I don't know.

1021
01:26:57,055 --> 01:26:58,679
Who ordered you to do that?

1022
01:26:59,118 --> 01:27:00,734
I took orders from no one...

1023
01:27:01,459 --> 01:27:03,030
and worked with no one!

1024
01:27:03,411 --> 01:27:05,158
It was all me.

1025
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,115
Your Majesty ...

1026
01:27:22,115 --> 01:27:24,618
would you like me to interrogate
Lui Jianxing?

1027
01:27:24,618 --> 01:27:26,867
I'll make sure he spill out the
other members.

1028
01:27:28,769 --> 01:27:30,644
I've already killed hundreds.

1029
01:27:31,062 --> 01:27:34,264
Even Yuan Chonghuan built a
temple for Wei.

1030
01:27:35,381 --> 01:27:36,904
Do you want to kill him too?

1031
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,342
You want there to be no man
at my command?

1032
01:27:40,837 --> 01:27:42,278
I would never dare.

1033
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:45,270
Don't let Lui Jianxing name
any more names.

1034
01:27:46,408 --> 01:27:48,376
Kill him!
- I understand.

1035
01:27:49,793 --> 01:27:51,643
Why is Zhao Jingzhong not here?

1036
01:27:51,945 --> 01:27:53,477
Zhao Jingzhong ...

1037
01:27:54,765 --> 01:27:56,217
He disappeared.

1038
01:28:35,731 --> 01:28:37,557
<i>Clique Member Lui Jianxing...</i>

1039
01:28:38,308 --> 01:28:39,937
<i>to be executed!</i>

1040
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:44,459
I'm sorry.

1041
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:49,153
I'm so sorry for everything.

1042
01:28:52,851 --> 01:28:54,507
<i>The indentity of the criminal...</i></i>

1043
01:28:54,514 --> 01:28:56,208
<i>has been verified.</i></i>

1044
01:28:56,447 --> 01:28:57,718
<i>Execute!</i>

1045
01:29:11,565 --> 01:29:13,366
I'm so sorry for everything!

1046
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:25,389
Sir Jin.

1047
01:29:52,499 --> 01:29:56,470
<i>[ North Frontier, War Zone, 2 months later. ]</i>

1048
01:30:20,488 --> 01:30:22,751
He's still following us.
It's been two weeks now.

1049
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,258
We just can't lose him.

1050
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:25,804
It's Shen Lian.

1051
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:27,098
Shen Lian!

1052
01:31:27,177 --> 01:31:28,723
I gave you a change to live,

1053
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:31,559
and you came back to haunt me.

1054
01:31:32,216 --> 01:31:33,673
If I don't kill you,

1055
01:31:33,717 --> 01:31:35,447
I'm as good as dead.

1056
01:31:38,717 --> 01:31:40,662
You want 
to avenge your sworn brothers?

1057
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:44,285
Let me tell you something.

1058
01:31:44,526 --> 01:31:46,260
His Majesty only requested that...

1059
01:31:46,341 --> 01:31:48,273
Wei be taken back to the Capital,

1060
01:31:48,364 --> 01:31:50,198
but didn't want him dead.

1061
01:31:50,684 --> 01:31:52,317
It was me who wanted him dead.

1062
01:31:52,651 --> 01:31:53,862
You faked His Majesty's order.

1063
01:31:54,558 --> 01:31:56,261
Even if we killed Wei Zhongxian,

1064
01:31:56,369 --> 01:31:57,995
you would still kill us.

1065
01:32:00,456 --> 01:32:02,518
From the moment
I approached you three ...

1066
01:32:03,743 --> 01:32:05,517
you were dead already.

1067
01:32:30,056 --> 01:32:32,679
Which of you is
General Li Yongfang's friend?

1068
01:32:36,741 --> 01:32:38,520
I am Zhao Jingzhong.

1069
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:42,139
You're joining the Manchurians!

1070
01:32:43,763 --> 01:32:45,607
Those two Han men are enemies.

1071
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:56,580
Kill him! Go ...

1072
01:32:58,724 --> 01:33:00,349
As I said before,

1073
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,151
you're suicidal!

1074
01:33:02,434 --> 01:33:05,691
<i>The reason why our country
is wrecked with problems...</i>

1075
01:33:06,031 --> 01:33:08,456
<i>and people can barely make
ends meet ...</i>

1076
01:33:09,449 --> 01:33:11,637
<i>is because of people like you!</i>

1077
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:13,857
<i>As long as I'm standing...</i>

1078
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,308
you have no change of leaving alive.

1079
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:22,972
Ding Xiu, is no match for them.

1080
01:33:23,104 --> 01:33:24,843
And you ...

1081
01:33:25,502 --> 01:33:27,464
you really think you can kill me?

1082
01:33:45,498 --> 01:33:47,170
Arrows!

1083
01:35:28,982 --> 01:35:30,869
Your sidekick won't last
much longer.

1084
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,263
Neither will you!

1085
01:36:15,482 --> 01:36:17,823
Why did you approach us three
in the first place?

1086
01:36:18,269 --> 01:36:20,448
You worthless people ...

1087
01:36:22,018 --> 01:36:24,362
who would care if you died?

1088
01:36:25,429 --> 01:36:27,158
When I want you crushed,

1089
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:28,627
you are crushed!

1090
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:31,116
Zhao Jingzhong ...

1091
01:36:31,366 --> 01:36:33,525
you're no longer 
Commander of the Secret Police.

1092
01:36:33,773 --> 01:36:35,531
You lost everything ...

1093
01:36:35,908 --> 01:36:37,918
thanks to us worthless people.

1094
01:38:49,844 --> 01:38:51,359
<i>Go down south,</i>

1095
01:38:51,577 --> 01:38:53,179
<i>to Suzhou.</i>

1096
01:38:54,065 --> 01:38:55,607
<i>When you get there...</i>

1097
01:38:55,929 --> 01:38:57,737
<i>go to Qijia Lane...</i>

1098
01:38:58,324 --> 01:39:00,119
<i>and find the second courtyard
on the left.</i>

1099
01:39:00,599 --> 01:39:01,936
<i>Your Zhou Miaotong...</i>

1100
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,670
<i>and the Zhang girl ...</i>

1101
01:39:04,098 --> 01:39:05,628
<i>are both there.</i>

1102
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:09,667
Thank you.
- No need.

1103
01:39:11,334 --> 01:39:13,258
If you didn't kill Zhao Jingzhong ...

1104
01:39:14,145 --> 01:39:16,138
I would have killed you both.

1105
01:39:59,468 --> 01:40:02,586
<i>Jianxing ...
when we leave Beijing,</i>

1106
01:40:03,043 --> 01:40:05,199
<i>where would you want to go?
- Me?</i>

1107
01:40:05,656 --> 01:40:09,102
<i>To Quanzhou.
I want to show my mother the ocean,</i>

1108
01:40:09,524 --> 01:40:11,006
<i>and the big ships.</i>

1109
01:40:11,669 --> 01:40:13,334
<i>Lian, what about you?</i>

1110
01:40:14,832 --> 01:40:16,492
<i>Suzhou, I guess.</i>

1111
01:40:17,257 --> 01:40:18,659
<i>Enough about us.</i>

1112
01:40:18,781 --> 01:40:20,522
<i>Where do you want to go, Yichuan?</i>

1113
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:22,730
<i>I want to go
beyond the northern borders.</i>

1114
01:40:22,744 --> 01:40:24,522
<i>I heard there are very few people there.</i>

1115
01:40:24,574 --> 01:40:27,605
<i>I wonder ...
what that feels like.</i>
