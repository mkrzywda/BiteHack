00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:14,165
(singing along with "Brandy" on the car stereo)

4
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,103
- Come on!
- Slow down.

5
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:45,221
What do you say, my River Lily?
Come on!

6
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,704
Where are you taking me?

7
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:49,530
Come on, come on, come on.

8
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,263
Look. Look.

9
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:53,494
Oh, it's beautiful!

10
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:55,687
I was afraid it wouldn't
take to this soil.

11
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:57,386
But it rooted quickly.

12
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:00,047
And soon it'll be everywhere.

13
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:02,675
All across the universe.

14
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:05,873
Well I don't know what
you're talking about...

15
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,311
...but I like the
way you say it.

16
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:09,838
My heart is yours...

17
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:11,535
Meredith Quill.

18
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,752
I can't believe I fell
in love with a spaceman.

21
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,398
Showtime, a-holes!

22
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:11,377
It's gonna be here any minute.

23
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:12,886
Which will be its loss.

24
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,752
I thought your thing
was a sword.

25
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:17,516
We've been hired to stop an
inter-dimensional beast...

26
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,620
...from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

27
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,994
It's just, swords were your thing and
guns were mine

28
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:26,050
but I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

29
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:29,991
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

30
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:31,136
It hurts.

31
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:32,795
Hurts?

32
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:36,206
I have sensitive nipples.

33
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,986
My nipples hurt!
Oh goodness me!

34
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,220
What about him?
What's he doing?

35
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,171
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,580
How is that a priority?

37
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,711
Blame Quill.
He's the one who loves music so much.

38
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:50,725
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

39
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,343
That's hardly important right now.

40
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:55,083
Oh, Okay.
Sure, Quill.

41
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:58,180
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

42
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,918
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

43
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:04,540
I can clearly see you winking.

44
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,767
Dammit.
I'm using my left eye?

45
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,521
I am Groot.

46
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:17,181
They were not looking
at you funny.

47
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,520
That's intense.

<i>GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2</i>

Groot!

50
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,686
Groot, get out of the way!
You're going to get hurt!

51
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,820
Hi!

52
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,341
No, no!
Spit it out, spit it out!

53
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:38,397
Come on!

54
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,999
Disgusting!

55
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,195
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

56
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,385
I must cut through it from the inside.

57
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:54,218
Huh?

58
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:56,452
No, no, Drax!
Wait a minute!

59
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:57,244
Drax!

60
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,307
What is he doing?

61
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:10,404
He said the skin is too thick to be
pierced from the outside, so he...

62
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:12,118
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

63
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,639
Skin's the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

64
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:15,643
I realize that.

65
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:20,638
There is a cut on its neck.

66
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,513
Rocket, get it to look up.

67
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:29,311
Hey, giant sea monkey!
I'm here!

68
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:37,337
Watch it, Quill!

69
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:22,024
Yes!
I have single handedly...

70
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:23,363
...vanquished the beast!

71
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,357
What?

72
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:37,800
What are they called again?

73
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:39,568
Anulax batteries.

74
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:41,391
Harbulary batteries.

75
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:43,942
That's nothing like
what I just said.

76
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:46,349
But they're worth thousands
of units a piece, which is...

77
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:47,737
why the Sovereign hired
us to protect them.

78
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:50,723
Careful what you say around these
folks, they're easily offended.

79
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,382
The cost of transgression is death.

80
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:57,641
We thank you Guardians for putting
your lives on the line.

81
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:01,581
We could not risk the lives of
our own Sovereign citizens.

82
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:05,474
Every citizen is born exactly
as designed by the community.

83
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,714
Impeccable, both physically
and mentally.

84
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:11,193
We control the DNA of our progeny...

85
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:12,843
...germinating them in birthing pods.

86
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:16,444
I guess I prefer to make people
the old fashioned way.

87
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:17,590
Well...

88
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:20,266
Perhaps someday you could
give me a history lesson...

89
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:22,642
...in the archaic ways
of our ancestors.

90
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,161
For academic purposes.

91
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,107
I would be honored.
Yes.

92
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,287
In the name of research...

93
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:31,128
I think that could be...

94
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:32,572
...pretty uh, repulsive. I'm...

95
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:34,691
I'm not into that kind of casual...

96
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,058
Please...

97
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,041
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

98
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:40,021
Bring it...

99
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,420
...and we shall gladly
be on our way.

100
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:56,747
Family reunion. Yay!

101
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,084
I understand she
is your sister.

102
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,763
She's worth no more to me than
the bounty due for her on Xandar.

103
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:06,690
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

104
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:09,534
Do with her as you please.

105
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:15,300
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

106
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,388
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

107
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,926
My mother was from Earth.

108
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:24,011
And your father?

109
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:29,282
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

110
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,352
I see it within you.

111
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,093
An unorthodox genealogy.

112
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:39,893
A hybrid that seems particularly...

113
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:42,797
...wreckless.

114
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:48,049
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags.

115
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:50,397
But that isn't true at all.

116
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:59,507
Ah, shit. I'm using my wrong
eye again, aren't I?

117
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,002
I'm sorry, that was... that was
meant to be behind your back.

118
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,707
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

119
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:08,150
You're telling me.

120
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:10,345
- You want to buy some batteries?
- Ha ha ha!

121
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:28,747
All right, let's get baldly to Xandar
and collect that bounty.

<i>Awesome Mix Vol. 2</i>

123
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:28,751
That stuff about my father.

124
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,279
Who does she thing she is?

125
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:34,060
I know you're sensitive about that.

126
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,151
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

127
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,270
Sorry if it seemed like I was
flirting with the High Priestess.

128
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:43,677
I wasn't.

129
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:45,507
I don't care if you were.

130
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:48,096
Well I feel like you do care.

131
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:51,385
That's why I'm apologizing.
So, sorry.

132
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:54,120
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

133
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:56,479
Damn shadow.

134
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,428
There are two types of
beings in the universe.

135
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:01,739
Those who dance and
those who do not.

136
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:03,363
Mmm-hmm.

137
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:05,580
I first met my beloved
at a war rally.

138
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:06,847
Oh god.

139
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:10,485
Everyone in the village
flailed about dancing.

140
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:11,783
Except one woman.

141
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,009
My Ovette.

142
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:17,537
I knew immediately she
was the one for me.

143
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:21,268
The most melodic song in the
world could be playing.

144
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:23,679
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

145
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:26,277
Wouldn't move a muscle.

146
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:29,583
One might assume she was dead.

147
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,250
That does sound pretty hot.

148
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:35,076
It would make my nether-regions engorged.

149
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:37,053
Okay I get it, yes.

150
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:40,296
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

151
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:44,369
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic, like you.

152
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:53,723
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that Yaro root.

153
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,618
No.
It's not ripe yet...

154
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,411
...and I hate you.

155
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:57,638
You hate me?

156
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:01,048
You left me there while you
stole that stone for yourself.

157
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:03,889
And yet here you
stand, a hero.

158
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:07,446
I will be free of these shackles
soon and I will kill you.

159
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:08,851
I swear.

160
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:09,890
No.

161
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:13,702
You're gonna live out the rest of
your days in a prison on Xandar,

162
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,455
wishing you could.

163
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:23,211
This is weird.

164
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,419
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

165
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,179
Why would they do that?

166
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,056
Perhaps because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

167
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,835
Dude!

168
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,202
Right.

169
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:31,489
He didn't steal some of those.

170
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,544
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

171
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,361
What were you thinking?

172
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,948
Dude, they were really
easy to steal!

173
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,315
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

174
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,569
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

175
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:52,173
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

176
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,762
Oh, I didn't realize your
motivation was altruism.

177
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:58,348
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

178
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,821
...and are trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

179
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:01,373
I was being sarcastic!

180
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:02,153
Oh no!

181
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:05,454
You're supposed to use the sarcastic tone!
Now I look foolish!

182
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,518
Can we put the bickering on hold...

183
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,585
...'til after we've survived
this massive space battle?

184
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:10,147
- More incoming!
- Good!

185
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:11,366
I want to kill some guys!

186
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:20,117
You're not killing anyone.

187
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:21,803
All those ships are remotely piloted.

188
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:25,670
Dammit!

189
00:16:35,224 --> 00:16:37,491
What is the delay, Admiral?

190
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:41,301
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

191
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:42,979
...and could destroy the entire fleet.

192
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:45,352
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

193
00:16:46,397 --> 00:16:49,020
We hired them and
they steal from us.

194
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,183
It's heresy of the highest order.

195
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:54,783
All command modules...

196
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,775
...fire with the intent to kill.

197
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,322
What's the nearest
habital planet?

198
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,593
It's called Berhert.

199
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:12,178
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

200
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:14,730
But the access point is
47 clicks away.

201
00:17:15,557 --> 00:17:17,752
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

202
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,134
Quill, to make it through that...

203
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,804
...you'd have to be the
greatest pilot in the universe.

204
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:30,794
Luck for us...

205
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:32,054
- I...
- I am.

206
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:44,990
What are you doing?

207
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:47,087
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

208
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,734
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

209
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:52,370
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

210
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:53,447
Stop it!

211
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:55,689
Quill, later on tonight, you're
gonna be laying down in your bed...

212
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,870
...and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillowcase.

213
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,095
And you're gonna be like,
What's this?

214
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:01,143
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there.

215
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:04,490
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

216
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,299
Oh, it won't be my turd.

217
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:07,310
- It'll be Drax's.
- Ha ha ha ha!

218
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,807
I have famously huge turds.

219
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,196
We're about to die, and
this is what we're discussing?

220
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:19,116
Son of a...!
Dude! Seriously!

221
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,701
Hey, let me...

222
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:35,091
Idiots!

223
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:37,429
Ah! That's what you get when Quill flies.

224
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,465
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

225
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:45,529
Our weapons are down.

226
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:47,847
Twenty clicks to the jump.

227
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,850
Hold on.

228
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:02,406
It's not ripe.

229
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:05,892
<i>SPACESUITS FOR EMERGENCY
OR FOR FUN.</i>

230
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:12,515
Come on, Zylak.
You can do this.

231
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,133
- Yes!
- Yes, yes!

232
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:19,855
15 clicks to the jump.

233
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,204

234
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:23,619
(cheers)

235
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:39,829
10 clicks!

236
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:45,687
Die, spaceship!

237
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:52,245
You suck, Zylak.

238
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:53,253
Typical.

239
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:57,680
It's 5 clicks!

240
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:05,359
Son of a...!

241
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:07,668
They went around the field!

242
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,869
Someone destroyed all our ships!

243
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:27,235
What?

244
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,163
Who?

245
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:34,553
One click!

246
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,988
- What is that?
- Who cares?

247
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:40,107
That's the jump point!
Go, go!

248
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:44,529
It's a guy.

249
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,381
Oh my god.

250
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,785
He's still out there?

251
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,668
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

252
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,977
Prepare for a really bad landing!

253
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:31,978
<i>BERHERT</i>

254
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:15,955
Ha ha ha ha!
That was awesome!

255
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:19,049
Ha ha ha! Yes!

256
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:22,451
Look at this!

257
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:25,540
Where's the other half of our ship?

258
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,263
My ship.

259
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:29,552
Either one of you could've gotten
us through that field...

260
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:33,000
...had you flown with what's between
your ears instead of what's between your legs!

261
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:37,185
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

262
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:40,107
...I guarantee I could've
landed this ship with it.

263
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:43,345
Peter. We almost died because
of your arrogance.

264
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:44,238
No, like, because he stole...

265
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:46,542
...Anulax batteries.

266
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:49,174
They're called Harbulary batteries.

267
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:50,754
No, they're not!

268
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,489
You know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?

269
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:55,433
I'm not gonna answer
to Star-Munch.

270
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:58,345
- I did it because I wanted to!
- Dick.

271
00:22:58,346 --> 00:23:00,189
What are we even talking
about this for?

272
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,951
We just had a little man save
us by blowing up 50 ships!

273
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:04,961
How little?

274
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,729
I, I don't know, like this?

275
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:09,208
A little one-inch man saved us?

276
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,795
Well, if he got closer, I'm
sure he'd be much larger.

277
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,429
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

278
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:15,901
Don't call me a raccoon!

279
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,611
I'm sorry.
I took it too far.

280
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,454
I meant trash panda.

281
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,698
Is that better?

282
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:26,568
I don't know.

283
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,954
It's worse. It's so much worse.

284
00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:31,322
You son of a...!

285
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:32,404
Hey!

286
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,171
- I've about had it with you!
- No! Back off!

287
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:36,144

through the jump point.

288

289

I'm not a fool, Nebula.

290
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,455
You are a fool to deprive
yourself a hand in combat.

291
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:45,795
You'll attack me the moment
I let you go.

No I won't.

293
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:50,244
You would think an evil super-villain
would learn how to properly lie.

294
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:52,534
I bet it's the one-inch man..

295
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:29,603
After all these years,
I've found you.

And who the hell are you?

297
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:35,791
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

298
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,896
My name is Ego.

00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:44,453
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

325
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:46,833
You didn't know 'cause you didn't
want to know 'cause it made you rich.

326
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:51,436
I demand a seat at the table.
I wear these flames, same as you.

327
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:52,771
You may dress like us...

328
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,467
...but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

329
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:57,461
And the Colors of Orgord...

330
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:00,447
...will never lash over your grave.

331
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,035
If you think...

332
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:07,714
I take pleasure in exiling you...

333
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:10,272
...you're wrong.

334
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:13,904
You broke all all our hearts.

335
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:30,098
Pathetic.

336
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,439
First, Quill betrays us...

337
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:37,066
...and Yondu just lets
him go scott-free.

338
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:39,981
We followed him...

339
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:42,127
...because he was the one who wasn't
afraid to do what needed to be done.

340
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,171
Seems he's going soft.

341
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,684
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering for?

342
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:50,095
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

343
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:54,770
You best be very careful what
you say about our captain.

344
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,391
Who is that?

345
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,718
Yondu Udonta.

346
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,783
I have a proposition for you.

347
00:28:44,464 --> 00:28:46,552
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

348
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:48,855
...when your mother passed away.

349
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:50,851
But, instead of returning you...

350
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,870
...Yondu kept you.

351
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:55,601
I have no clue as to why.

352
00:28:57,546 --> 00:28:58,618
Well, I'll tell you why.

353
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,759
'Cause I was a skinny little kid who
could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

354
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,093
It made it easier for thieving.

355
00:29:04,204 --> 00:29:07,689
Well. I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

356
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:09,705
I thought Yondu was your father.

357
00:29:09,853 --> 00:29:12,582
What? We've been together
this whole time...

358
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:14,678
...and you thought Yondu was
my actual blood relative?

359
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:16,910
You look exactly alike.

360
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,392
One's blue!

361
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:22,457
No, he's not my father!

362
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:24,869
Yondu is the guy
who abducted me.

363
00:29:24,978 --> 00:29:27,031
Kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight.

364
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:29,804
And kept me in terror by
threatening to eat me.

365
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:31,278
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

366
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:33,171
Ah, that son of a bitch!

367
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:35,187
How did you locate us now?

368
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:39,155
Well, even where I reside, out
past the edge what's known...

369
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,812
...we've heard tell about the
man they call Star-Lord.

370
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:44,010
What say we head out there right now?

371
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:47,606
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-face monkey, there.

372
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:49,373
I promise you...

373
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,536
...it's not like any other
place you've ever seen.

374
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:54,206
And there...

375
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:59,458
I can explain your very
special heritage.

376
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:01,977
Finally get to be the...

377
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:04,292
...father I've always wanted to be.

378
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:08,025
Excuse me.

379
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:10,400
I've gotta take a whiz.

380
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,253
I'm not buying it.

381
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,465
Let's go take a walk.

382
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:31,570
I am Mantis.

383
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,222
What are you doing?

384
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:38,687
Smiling.

385
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:43,002
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

386
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:45,773
Not if you do it like that.

387
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:50,487
Oh.
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

388
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:54,705
I do not understand the
intricacies of social interaction.

389
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:00,949
Can I pet your puppy?
It's adorable.

390
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:05,760
Yes.

391
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:06,761
Ha ha ha ha!

392
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:18,789
That is called a practical joke!

393
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,196
I liked it very much!

394
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,969
I just made it up.

395
00:31:30,668 --> 00:31:32,203
Give me a break!

396
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,975
After all this time, you're gonna
show up and just all of a sudden...

397
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:37,321
...you want to be my dad?
- I hear you.

398
00:31:37,434 --> 00:31:38,909
You know, by the way,
this could be a trap.

399
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:41,393
Ok? The Kree ~Perus, the Ravagers...

400
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,446
...they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

401
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:44,313
But, what?

402
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,444
What was that story you told
me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

403
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:48,560
Who?

404
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:50,354
He owned a magic boat.

405
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,149
David Hasselhoff?

406
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:54,160
Right.

407
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:56,790
Not in a magic boat.
A talking car.

408
00:31:56,869 --> 00:31:58,272
Why did he talk, again?

409
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:01,801
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

410
00:32:01,911 --> 00:32:04,569
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

411
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:05,979
and you would tell all
the other children...

412
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:08,528
...that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

413
00:32:08,604 --> 00:32:10,846
Shooting Knight Rider or touring
with his band in Germany.

414
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:13,194
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing it up now?

415
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,347
I love that story.

416
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:15,750
I hate that story.

417
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,482
It's so sad!

418
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:21,939
As a kid, I used to see all the other
kids all playing catch with their dad.

419
00:32:22,552 --> 00:32:25,358
And I wanted that, more than
anything in the world.

420
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:26,802
That's my point, Peter.

421
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:30,468
What if this man
is your Hasselhoff?

422
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:35,569
Listen. If he ends
up being evil...

423
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:37,868
...we'll just kill him.

424
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,860
You're leaving me with that fox?

425
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,194
He's not a fox.

426
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,212
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

427
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,344
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

428
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:56,090
Hey. It'll be just a
couple of days.

429
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,689
We'll be back before Rocket's
finished fixing the ship.

430
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:03,596
What if Sovereign come?

431
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:05,683
There's no way for them to
know we're here. Let's go.

432
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:07,839
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

433
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:09,052
God, you're like an old woman.

434
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:10,503
Because I'm wise?

435
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:13,470
Why do you have so much luggage?

436
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,670
I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

437
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,886
I hope daddy isn't as big of a
dick as you, orphan boy.

438
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:26,994
What is your goal here?
To get everbody to hate you?

439
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:29,117
Because it's working.

440
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,825
Hey. Can I ask you a
personal question?

441
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:19,360
Oh! Noone has ever asked
me a personal question.

442
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:20,739
Your antennae, what are they for?

443
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:22,345
Their purpose?

444
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:24,432
Yes, Quill and I have a bet.

445
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:27,025
Ugh. You're not supposed to say that.

446
00:34:27,096 --> 00:34:28,031
I say...

447
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,300
that if you're about to go through
a doorway that's too low...

448
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:33,502
...the antennae will feel this and
keep you from being decapitated.

449
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:36,019
Right.
And if it's anything other than...

450
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:39,003
...you specifically not being
decapitated by a doorway, I win.

451
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:41,232
They are not for feeling doorways.

452
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:43,819
I think...

453
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:46,845
...they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

454
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:48,049
What are those?

455
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,895
If I touch someone, I can
feel their feelings.

456
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,764
- You read minds?
- No.

457
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:55,879
Telepaths know thoughts.

458
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:58,224
Empaths feel feelings.

459
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:00,990
Emotions.

460
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:03,980
May I?

461
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,211
Oh, all right.

462
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:15,325
You feel love.

463
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:20,324
Yeah, I guess feel a general
unselfish love for just about everybody...

464
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:21,766
No!

465
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:24,288
Romantic, sexual love.

466
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:25,233
No. No I don't.

467
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:27,915
- For her!
- No! That is not...

468
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,470
Okay.

469
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:37,035
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

470
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,670
Dude, come on, I think you're
overreacting a little bit.

471
00:35:39,778 --> 00:35:41,683
You must be so embarrassed!
Aha ha ha ha!

472
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,761
Do me!
Do me! Do me!

473
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:55,804
I have never felt such humor.

474
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:01,791
So unbelievably not cool.

475
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,708
Quill.

476
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:12,280
Touch me, and the only thing you're
gonna feel is a broken jaw.

477
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:22,931
I can also alter emotions,
to some extent.

478
00:36:23,037 --> 00:36:23,986
Yeah, like what?

479
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:26,504
If I touch someone who is sad...

480
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,761
...I can ease them into
contentment for a short while.

481
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,762
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

482
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:38,586
But I mostly use it to
help my master sleep.

483
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:43,482
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

484
00:36:45,715 --> 00:36:46,920
Do one of those on me.

485
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,032
Sleep.

486
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:05,266
I love this song.

487
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:10,763
There!

488
00:39:48,196 --> 00:39:49,645
Ain't so tough now,
without all your toys.

489
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:50,910
Are ya?

490
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:55,436
Move!

491
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:12,095
Crap.

492
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:18,889
Hey there, rat!

493
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:21,190
How's it going, you blue idiot?

494
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,202
Not so bad.

495
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,335
We got ourselves a pretty
good little gig here.

496
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:29,250
This golden gal with quite a
high opinion of herself...

497
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:33,545
...has offered us a large sum to
deliver you and your pals over to her...

498
00:40:33,621 --> 00:40:34,885
...'cause she wants to kill y'all.

499
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:36,586
Your Friend...

500
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:38,601
There's too many of them.

501
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:41,836
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

502
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,754
...you need to get
me out of these bonds.

503
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:46,696
They are going to kill him!

504
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:49,181
I'll tell you, it was
pretty easy to find you.

505
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,274
I put a tracer on
your ship back there...

506
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:52,786
...during the war with Xandar.

507
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:55,123
Give me your word you
won't hurt Groot...

508
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:57,254
...and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

509
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,708
Lucky for you, my
word don't mean squat.

510
00:41:00,782 --> 00:41:03,263
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

511
00:41:03,372 --> 00:41:05,237
Otherwise... what?

512
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:06,931
We'll take them batteries.

513
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:10,355
They're worth, what, a
quarter mil on the open market?

514
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:12,762
That Priestess offered
us a million.

515
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,784
A quarter is only one third of that!

516
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:16,976
A quarter ain't a third.

517
00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:18,813
A quarter is 25.

518
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:19,676
No.

519
00:41:19,787 --> 00:41:22,552
We can't even buy a pair
of boots with 25 units.

520
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,418
Enough!

521
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:27,989
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to
help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

522
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:30,794
The whole dang Nova Corps'd be on us.

523
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:32,379
That ain't right!

524
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:35,581
I just gotta say it this
one time, captain.

525
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:38,133
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

526
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:41,656
...you protect him like none
of the rest of us much matter.

527
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:42,733
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

528
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:44,495
Take it easy, Kraglin.

529
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:45,580
Damn straight, lads.
He's gone soft.

530
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,851
I suppose it's time for
a change in leadership.

531
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,697
Put your ~gob guns down!

532
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:58,599
Whoa! Whoa!

533
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,391
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

534
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,486
Or even a violent one, where
I'm standing over there.

535
00:42:02,597 --> 00:42:05,146
Well, hello boys.

536
00:42:23,747 --> 00:42:25,474
It's not ripe.

537
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:31,949
<i>EGO'S PLANET</i>

538
00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:22,210
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

539
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:25,592
Wow. You have your own planet?

540
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,045
Come on. It's no larger
than your Earth's moon.

541
00:43:29,118 --> 00:43:30,742
Humility.

542
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:32,394
I like it.

543
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:35,637
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

544
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:24,479
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

545
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:26,744
What are you exactly?

546
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:31,879
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

547
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:35,847
A Celestial, like a God?

548
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:39,549
Oh, a small "g", son.

549
00:44:39,658 --> 00:44:42,687
At least on the days I'm
feeling as humble as Drax.

550
00:44:58,311 --> 00:45:01,537
I don't know where I came from, exactly.

551
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,520
The first thing I remember is...

552
00:45:03,628 --> 00:45:06,790
...flickering. Adrift in
the cosmos, utterly...

553
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,174
...and entirely alone.

554
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:13,480
Over millions of years...

555
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:17,297
...I learned to control
the molecules around me.

556
00:45:17,407 --> 00:45:21,063
I grew smarter and stronger.

557
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:26,160
And I continued building from there.

558
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:28,209
Layer by layer...

559
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:31,339
...the very planet you walk on now.

560
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:32,874
Whoa.

561
00:45:33,629 --> 00:45:35,069
But I wanted more.

562
00:45:35,904 --> 00:45:37,378
I desired...

563
00:45:38,352 --> 00:45:39,681
...meaning.

564
00:45:40,658 --> 00:45:44,325
There must be some life out
there in the universe...

565
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:47,122
...besides just me, I thought.

566
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:51,832
And so, I set myself to task
for finding it.

567
00:45:52,735 --> 00:45:54,172
I created...

568
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:58,313
...what I imagined biological
life to be like...

569
00:45:58,426 --> 00:46:02,522
...down to the most minute detail.

570
00:46:03,562 --> 00:46:05,148
Did you make a penis?

571
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:06,301
Dude!

572
00:46:06,445 --> 00:46:07,862
What is wrong with you?

573
00:46:08,003 --> 00:46:11,491
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

574
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:14,081
He would smush her!

575
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:16,908
I... ugh! I don't need to hear
how my parents...

576
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:19,540
Why?

577
00:46:20,302 --> 00:46:24,556
My father would tell the story of
impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

578
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:26,002
That's disgusting.

579
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:27,331
It was beautiful.

580
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:30,546
You Earthers have hang-ups.

581
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:33,391
Yes, Drax.
I got a penis.

582
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:35,232
Ha! Thank you.

583
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:36,715
- And it's not half bad.
- Huh!

584
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:41,897
I also have pain receptors
and a digestive system...

585
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:44,715
...and all the accompanying junk.

586
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:49,464
I wanted to experience what it
truly meant to be human.

587
00:46:49,572 --> 00:46:52,273
As I set out amongst the stars...

588
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,479
...'til I found...

589
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:57,317
...what I sought.

590
00:46:59,254 --> 00:47:00,229
Life.

591
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,961
I was not alone in the
universe after all.

592
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:11,692
When did you meet my mother?

593
00:47:15,654 --> 00:47:17,278
Not long after.

594
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,862
It was, with Meredith, that I
first experienced love.

595
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:32,510
I called her my River Lily.

596
00:47:37,156 --> 00:47:39,021
And from that love, Peter...

597
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:43,558
You.

598
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:53,148
I've searched for you for so long.

599
00:47:54,728 --> 00:47:56,851
And when I heard of
a man from Earth...

600
00:47:56,923 --> 00:47:59,949
...who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

601
00:48:00,748 --> 00:48:04,236
...I knew you must be the
son of the woman I loved.

602
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:07,582
If you loved her, why
did you leave her?

603
00:48:14,883 --> 00:48:16,597
You should ~?

604
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:19,666
You should ~?

605
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:28,924
You should ~?

606
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,450
Sorry about this!

607
00:49:18,118 --> 00:49:19,200
Captain!

608
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,416
Help me!
Please help!

609
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:23,060
Captain!

610
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:28,061
You're the one what killed those men...

611
00:49:28,169 --> 00:49:30,124
...by leading them
down the wrong path.

612
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:32,137
Because you're weak.

613
00:49:34,368 --> 00:49:35,735
And stupid!

614
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:40,023
It's time for the Ravengers...

615
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:43,445
...to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

616
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:45,753
Taserface!

617
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:46,754
Aha ha ha ha!

618
00:49:53,495 --> 00:49:55,536
I'm sorry.
Your name is...

619
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:57,192
...it's Taserface?

620
00:49:58,065 --> 00:49:58,897
That's right.

621
00:49:59,006 --> 00:50:01,594
Do you shoot tasers
out of your face?

622
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:03,964
It's metaphorical!

623
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:05,941
Yeah!

624
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:08,888
For what?

625
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,290
For...
It is a name what strikes fear...

626
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,837
...into the hearts of
anyone what hears it!

627
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:19,212
Okay.

628
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,170
Okay...

629
00:50:21,278 --> 00:50:22,391
Whatever you say.

630
00:50:23,222 --> 00:50:24,099
You shut up.

631
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:25,287
You're next.

632
00:50:26,078 --> 00:50:30,862
Udonta, I've been
waiting a long time to...

633
00:50:30,939 --> 00:50:32,053
What?

634
00:50:34,175 --> 00:50:36,769
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

635
00:50:36,877 --> 00:50:40,123
I just keep imagining
you waking up in the morning, sir...

636
00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:42,206
...looking in the mirror and,
in all seriousness, saying to yourelf...

637
00:50:43,279 --> 00:50:48,456
You know what would be a really
kick-ass name? Taserface!

638
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:52,811
Ah ha ha!
That's how I hear you in my head!

639
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:56,917
I can't take it anymore!
What was your second choice?

640
00:50:57,035 --> 00:50:58,244
Scrotum Hat?

641
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:04,222
New plan.
We're killing you first.

642
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,686
Well. Dying is certainly better than
having to live an entire life...

643
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:13,860
...as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

644
00:51:13,973 --> 00:51:16,813
That's enough killing for today.

645
00:51:20,158 --> 00:51:22,976
She's the daughter of Thanos.

646
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,683
I thought you were the biggest
sadist in the galaxy.

647
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:31,019
That was when daddy was
paying my bills.

648
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,691
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

649
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:39,653
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

650
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:42,713
I assure you...

651
00:51:42,826 --> 00:51:46,316
I am not as easy a mark as an
old man without his magic stick...

652
00:51:46,425 --> 00:51:48,230
...or a talking woodland beast.

653
00:51:50,142 --> 00:51:51,582
I want ten percent of the take.

654
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:55,835
And a couple more things.

655
00:51:57,711 --> 00:51:59,652
We got a whole box of hands...

656
00:51:59,765 --> 00:52:01,958
...if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

657
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:06,092
You, uh, think them Kree is
gonna execute the captain?

658
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:09,764
The Kree consider themselves
merciful. It will be painless.

659
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:14,436
Well, uh, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

660
00:52:14,514 --> 00:52:16,965
The location of Ego's planet
in the nav.

661
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:19,197
We'll wire you the ten percent
once we's paid.

662
00:52:19,271 --> 00:52:21,534
What're you gonna do
with your share?

663
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:26,894
As a child, my father would have Gamora
and me battle one another in training.

664
00:52:28,337 --> 00:52:30,391
Every time my sister prevailed...

665
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:34,064
...my father would replace a
piece of me with machinery...

666
00:52:34,174 --> 00:52:37,982
...claiming he wanted me
to be her equal.

667
00:52:39,192 --> 00:52:40,536
But she won.

668
00:52:41,186 --> 00:52:47,097
Again and again and again,
never once refraining.

669
00:52:48,108 --> 00:52:50,412
So, after I murder my sister...

670
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:55,127
...I will buy a warship will every
conceivable instrument of death.

671
00:52:55,197 --> 00:52:59,295
I will hunt my father like a
dog and I will tear him apart slowly...

672
00:52:59,404 --> 00:53:00,969
...piece by piece...

673
00:53:01,065 --> 00:53:05,359
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

674
00:53:05,466 --> 00:53:08,347
...I know every single day.

675
00:53:10,213 --> 00:53:11,687
Yeah...

676
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:15,053
...I was talking about
a pretty necklace.

677
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:17,566
Or a nice hat, you know.

678
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:21,056
Something to make the other
girls go, Ooooh, that's nice.

679
00:53:25,013 --> 00:53:28,428
Anyways, happy trails.

680
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:40,495
My mother told everyone my
father was from the stars.

681
00:53:43,384 --> 00:53:46,371
She had brain cancer, so
everyone thought she was delusional.

682
00:53:46,372 --> 00:53:47,129
Peter.

683
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:49,760
Listen, I'd love to believe
all of this, I really would.

684
00:53:49,828 --> 00:53:50,908
But you left...

685
00:53:51,015 --> 00:53:54,794
The most wonderful woman ever...

686
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,592
...to die alone.

687
00:53:56,701 --> 00:54:00,042
I didn't want to leave
your mother, Peter.

688
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:02,997
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

689
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:04,761
...and the light within it...

690
00:54:04,835 --> 00:54:06,861
...this form will wither and perish.

691
00:54:06,968 --> 00:54:09,266
Then why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

692
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:11,859
A criminal, of all people, to
come and to fetch me.

693
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:13,866
I loved your mother, Peter!

694
00:54:13,939 --> 00:54:16,674
I couldn't stand to step
foot on an Earth...

695
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:19,913
...where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

696
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,285
I know exactly what that feels like!

697
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:24,769
I had to watch her die!

698
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,055
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

699
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:37,102
...I've made many mistakes, Peter.

700
00:54:38,468 --> 00:54:40,446
But you're not one of them.

701
00:54:42,499 --> 00:54:46,608
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

702
00:54:52,311 --> 00:54:57,328
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

703
00:54:58,736 --> 00:55:00,040
...and the light within.

704
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:03,333
They are a part of you, Peter.

705
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:06,439
What do you mean?

706
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:10,067
Give me your hand, son.

707
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,427
Here.

708
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,090
Hold them like that.

709
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:24,498
Now, close your eyes
and concentrate.

710
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:29,079
Take your brain to the
center of this planet.

711
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,472
Yes!
Yes!

712
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:37,630
Whoa!

713
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:39,346
- Yes!
- What was it?

714
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,401
It's okay, just relax.
Concentrate.

715
00:55:41,473 --> 00:55:42,843
You can do it.
Bring it back.

716
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,576
Yes!

717
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,716
Yes, now, shape it.

718
00:55:47,864 --> 00:55:51,274
Feel that energy.

719
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:56,364
Yes.

720
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,470
You're home.

721
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:04,940
Peter.

722
00:56:38,647 --> 00:56:41,310
How'd you get to this
weird, dumb planet?

723
00:56:42,176 --> 00:56:44,441
Ego found me in my larvae state.

724
00:56:44,585 --> 00:56:46,533
Orphan on my homeworld.

725
00:56:47,254 --> 00:56:50,812
He raised me by hand and
kept me as his own.

726
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:52,901
So, you're a pet.

727
00:56:53,587 --> 00:56:55,169
I suppose.

728
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,950
People usually want cute pets.

729
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:01,106
Why would Ego want such
a hideous one?

730
00:57:01,214 --> 00:57:02,904
I am hideous?

731
00:57:03,017 --> 00:57:05,288
You are horrifying to look at, yes.

732
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:09,507
- But that's a good thing.
- Oh?

733
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:12,742
When you're ugly and
someone loves you...

734
00:57:12,814 --> 00:57:14,126
...you know they love
you for who you are.

735
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:18,308
Beautiful people never
know who to trust.

736
00:57:18,379 --> 00:57:21,618
Well, then I am certainly
grateful to be ugly.

737
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,513
Those pools, they remind
me of a time...

738
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:30,114
...when I took my daughter to the
Forgotten Lakes of my homeworld.

739
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,784
She was like you.

740
00:57:32,893 --> 00:57:34,115
Disgusting?

741
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:36,418
Innocent.

742
00:58:09,063 --> 00:58:10,141
Drax?

743
00:58:11,265 --> 00:58:12,952
There's something I
must tell you.

744
00:58:20,908 --> 00:58:22,172
What's going on?

745
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:24,139
This gross bug lady
is my new friend.

746
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:27,589
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

747
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:29,832
You're not ugly.
Drax.

748
00:58:29,903 --> 00:58:31,129
What are you talking about?

749
00:58:31,205 --> 00:58:32,176
Mantis.

750
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:34,122
Can you show us where
we'll be staying?

751
00:58:35,526 --> 00:58:37,288
Why are there no other
beings on this planet?

752
00:58:37,364 --> 00:58:39,023
The planet is Ego.

753
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:42,221
A dog would not invite a
flea to live on his back.

754
00:58:42,329 --> 00:58:43,594
And you're not a flea?

755
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:45,387
I'm a flea with a purpose.

756
00:58:46,577 --> 00:58:47,945
I help him sleep.

757
00:58:49,345 --> 00:58:52,186
What were you about to say
to Drax before I walked out?

758
00:58:57,202 --> 00:58:58,172
Nothing.

759
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,667
Your quarters are this way.

760
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:10,662
We deliver you to
the Kree in the morning.

761
00:59:13,874 --> 00:59:16,605
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

762
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:19,126
Okay, Taserface.

763
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:21,832
Hey, tell the other guys, we said...

764
00:59:21,944 --> 00:59:23,744
Hi, Taserface!

765
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:31,661
Oh! Hey, what about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

766
00:59:31,771 --> 00:59:32,926
No, Gef.

767
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:34,581
It's too adorable to kill.

768
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:36,308
Take it to the tailor.

769
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:41,027
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

770
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:48,442
I was a Kree battle slave for
20 years when Stakar freed me.

771
00:59:50,565 --> 00:59:52,790
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

772
00:59:53,473 --> 00:59:56,924
He said, all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

773
00:59:57,684 --> 00:59:59,300
But I was young...

774
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:03,937
...and greedy and stupid.

775
01:00:05,016 --> 01:00:07,065
Like you stealing those batteries.

776
01:00:07,172 --> 01:00:08,717
That was mostly Drax.

777
01:00:10,303 --> 01:00:12,880
Me & Stakar, and the other captains...

778
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:16,699
...we won't so different from
you and your friends.

779
01:00:17,637 --> 01:00:19,577
The only family I ever had.

780
01:00:20,448 --> 01:00:22,141
When I broke the code...

781
01:00:24,518 --> 01:00:26,062
...they exiled me.

782
01:00:27,215 --> 01:00:29,336
This is what I deserve.

783
01:00:29,443 --> 01:00:31,173
Slow down, drama queen.

784
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:32,474
You might deserve
this, but I don't.

785
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,845
We gotta get out of here.

786
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:36,915
Where's Quill?

787
01:00:37,023 --> 01:00:39,359
Ah, he went off with his old man.

788
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:41,844
- Ego?
- Yeah.

789
01:00:41,987 --> 01:00:44,003
It's a day for dumb-ass names.

790
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:50,157
You smiled. There for a second
I got a warm feeling.

791
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,419
But then it was ruined by
those disgusting-ass teeth.

792
01:00:52,497 --> 01:00:55,410
You're like, a professional
asshole, or what?

793
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,564
Pretty much a pro.

794
01:00:56,676 --> 01:00:58,907
Why didn't you deliver Quill
to Ego like you promised?

795
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,242
He was skinny.

796
01:01:02,142 --> 01:01:05,988
He fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thieving.

797
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:07,289
Uh huh.

798
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:14,114
I got an idea on how
to get out of here.

799
01:01:15,882 --> 01:01:17,717
But we're gonna need
your little friend.

800
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,026
Mascot! Mascot!
Mascot!

801
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:35,886
You fellas all want
~sausage drunk?

802
01:01:43,258 --> 01:01:45,345
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

803
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,503
It's god-dang precious.

804
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:03,104
Psst! Hey, twig!

805
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:04,470
Come here.

806
01:02:05,629 --> 01:02:06,603
Come on.

807
01:02:13,624 --> 01:02:14,743
Aw man.

808
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,116
What'd they do to you?

809
01:02:19,147 --> 01:02:21,376
Hey, you want to
help us get out of here?

810
01:02:22,315 --> 01:02:25,770
There's something I need you
to get and bring back to me.

811
01:02:25,877 --> 01:02:30,515
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin.

812
01:02:30,624 --> 01:02:32,674
The thing I wore in my head.

813
01:02:32,787 --> 01:02:37,137
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

814
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:38,225
You got it?

815
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:15,144
- Ugh.
- That's my underwear.

816
01:03:15,252 --> 01:03:17,515
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't
know what you were talking about.

817
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,320
You have to explain
it more careful.

818
01:03:20,858 --> 01:03:24,560
It's a prototype fin.

819
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:33,186
That's an Orloni.
It's a fin, Groot.

820
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:35,016
You try it this time.

821
01:03:36,026 --> 01:03:36,982
All right.

822
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:40,539
That's Vorker's eye.

823
01:03:40,648 --> 01:03:42,696
He takes it out when he sleeps.

824
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:44,290
Go, look again.

825
01:03:44,402 --> 01:03:45,620
But leave the eye here.

826
01:03:46,415 --> 01:03:47,277
Why?

827
01:03:47,387 --> 01:03:49,112
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

828
01:03:49,219 --> 01:03:50,978
and he's not gonna know...

829
01:03:51,086 --> 01:03:53,352
...where his eye is!
Ha ha ha ha!

830
01:04:00,096 --> 01:04:01,966
That's a desk.

831
01:04:02,074 --> 01:04:04,447
We told you it was this big.

832
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,093
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

833
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:15,471
...with a bunch of
severed human toes.

834
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:19,361
Okay, then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

835
01:04:23,397 --> 01:04:27,370
The drawer you want to open
has this symbol on it.

836
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:28,676
Okay?

837
01:04:37,845 --> 01:04:39,441
What? No!

838
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:41,206
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

839
01:04:41,285 --> 01:04:42,725
That's not what I said!

840
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:45,066
- I am Groot!
- He's relieved you don't want him to.

841
01:04:45,175 --> 01:04:46,793
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

842
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:47,589
I am Groot.

843
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:48,963
On anyone, not just himself.

844
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:49,823
I am Groot.

845
01:04:49,897 --> 01:04:51,553
One minute, you think someone
has a weird shaped head...

846
01:04:51,665 --> 01:04:54,254
...the next minute, just because,
you realize part of that head is the hat.

847
01:04:55,008 --> 01:04:56,375
That's why you don't like hats?

848
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:59,683
This is an important
conversation right now?

849
01:05:34,736 --> 01:05:35,743
What you have there?

850
01:05:44,189 --> 01:05:46,344
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

851
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,516
They killed all my friends.

852
01:05:53,935 --> 01:05:56,775
Get the third quadrant
ready for release.

853
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:04,113
One more thing.

854
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:07,823
You got any clones of
Quill's old music on the ship?

855
01:06:54,707 --> 01:06:56,149
He's got it!

856
01:06:56,227 --> 01:06:57,594
Yondu's got the fin!

857
01:06:57,707 --> 01:06:58,642
Go!

858
01:07:37,507 --> 01:07:38,698
Down there!

859
01:09:35,782 --> 01:09:37,686
You maniac!

860
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:41,514
The whole ship's gonna blow.

861
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:53,910
Not the whole ship.

862
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:13,392
Who is this?

863
01:10:13,465 --> 01:10:17,244
I am sending you the
coordinates for Yondu's ship.

864
01:10:18,513 --> 01:10:20,812
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, captain!

865
01:10:20,923 --> 01:10:22,251
I only ask one thing.

866
01:10:22,362 --> 01:10:25,417
That your High Priestess...

867
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:30,064
...tell him the name of
the man what sealed his fate.

868
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,761
Taserface!

869
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,702
Where to, captain?

870
01:10:59,776 --> 01:11:00,710
Ego.

871
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:04,058
No, boy!

872
01:11:12,264 --> 01:11:17,511
It ain't healthy, mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

873
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:18,526
I know that.

874
01:11:18,635 --> 01:11:21,114
We're about to do 700!

875
01:11:35,817 --> 01:11:38,337
So, I guess this could all
be mine someday.

876
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:42,539
Rocket?
Rocket, are you there?

877
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:51,451
What are you doing, Peter?

878
01:11:54,223 --> 01:11:55,806
Dance with me.

879
01:11:55,915 --> 01:11:57,930
I'm not going to dance with you.

880
01:11:58,038 --> 01:11:59,587
This is Sam Cooke...

881
01:12:00,342 --> 01:12:03,433
...one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

882
01:12:35,099 --> 01:12:37,149
Drax says you're not a dancer.

883
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:40,432
If you ever tell anyone about this...

884
01:12:40,572 --> 01:12:42,583
...I will kill you.

885
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:47,489
When are we going to do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

886
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,045
What unspoken thing?

887
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:52,741
This...

888
01:12:53,613 --> 01:12:56,133
...Cheers, Sam and Diane...

889
01:12:56,788 --> 01:12:59,763
...guy and a girl on a
TV show who dig each other...

890
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:02,244
...but never say it because the
TV ratings would go down...

891
01:13:02,355 --> 01:13:03,436
...sort of thing.

892
01:13:03,581 --> 01:13:05,268
There's no unspoken thing here.

893
01:13:07,571 --> 01:13:11,013
Well, it's a catch-22, because if
you said it then it would be spoken...

894
01:13:11,014 --> 01:13:14,013
...and you'd be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

895
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:17,752
...you are telling the truth
and admitting that there is.

896
01:13:19,155 --> 01:13:20,860
No, that's not what I...

897
01:13:23,302 --> 01:13:27,617
What we should be discussing
right now is, something about this place.

898
01:13:28,383 --> 01:13:29,958
It doesn't feel right.

899
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:32,068
What are you talking about?

900
01:13:32,898 --> 01:13:34,878
You're the one who
wanted me to come here.

901
01:13:34,984 --> 01:13:35,874
That girl, Mantis...

902
01:13:35,949 --> 01:13:37,275
...she's afraid of something.

903
01:13:37,384 --> 01:13:40,191
Why are you trying to take
this away from me?

904
01:13:40,263 --> 01:13:41,257
I'm not trying...

905
01:13:41,365 --> 01:13:43,930
He's my father.
He's blood.

906
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:45,951
Well you have blood on Earth,
you never wanted to return there.

907
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:47,719
Again, you made me come here.

908
01:13:47,802 --> 01:13:50,386
And Earth, Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

909
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:53,673
No, it's because that place is
real, and this is a fantasy.

910
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:56,479
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?

911
01:13:56,552 --> 01:13:58,136
That's the half I'm worried about.

912
01:13:58,214 --> 01:13:59,434
Oh, so... I get it.
You're jealous...

913
01:13:59,507 --> 01:14:03,749
...because I'm part god and
you like when I'm the weak one.

914
01:14:03,855 --> 01:14:06,011
You were insufferable to begin with.

915
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,891
I haven't been able
to reach Rocket.

916
01:14:07,997 --> 01:14:09,616
I'm going to go outside and
try to get a signal.

917
01:14:09,724 --> 01:14:12,270
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all.

918
01:14:12,383 --> 01:14:15,296
This is whatever the show is where
one person is willing to...

919
01:14:15,442 --> 01:14:18,388
...open themselves up to to new
possibilities, and the other person...

920
01:14:18,531 --> 01:14:21,908
...is a jerk who
doesn't trust anybody!

921
01:14:22,017 --> 01:14:24,103
It's a show that doesn't exist!

922
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:25,983
That's why it would get zero ratings.

923
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:28,744
I don't know what Cheers is.

924
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,191
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

925
01:14:58,321 --> 01:14:59,430
I thought you alread had.

926
01:15:30,102 --> 01:15:31,103
Psychopath!

927
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:31,524
Are you kidding me!

928
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:57,584
I win.

929
01:17:57,693 --> 01:17:59,594
I win, I bested you in combat.

930
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,720
No.
I saved your life.

931
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:03,658
Well you were stupid
enough to let me live.

932
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:04,428
You let me live!

933
01:18:04,498 --> 01:18:06,408
I don't need you to
always try and defeat me!

934
01:18:06,484 --> 01:18:08,890
I'm not the one who just flew across the
universe just because I wanted to win.

935
01:18:08,997 --> 01:18:10,830
Do not tell me what I want.

936
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:11,865
I don't need to tell
you what you want!

937
01:18:11,972 --> 01:18:12,781
It's obvious!

938
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:15,411
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

939
01:18:23,005 --> 01:18:24,370
You were all I had.

940
01:18:25,271 --> 01:18:27,750
But you were the one
who needed to win.

941
01:18:29,282 --> 01:18:31,144
Thanos pulled my eye
from my head...

942
01:18:31,902 --> 01:18:33,519
...and my brain from my skull...

943
01:18:34,929 --> 01:18:36,479
...and my arm from my body...

944
01:18:37,957 --> 01:18:39,787
...because of you.

945
01:18:50,368 --> 01:18:52,990
<i>AWESOME MIX VOL. 2</i>

946
01:19:03,778 --> 01:19:04,940
You all right, son?

947
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:11,953
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

948
01:19:12,098 --> 01:19:12,892
Yeah.

949
01:19:13,729 --> 01:19:15,057
It's fortuitous,...

950
01:19:15,171 --> 01:19:16,900
...you listening to this song.

951
01:19:17,477 --> 01:19:19,167
You know, uh, "Brandy?"

952
01:19:19,274 --> 01:19:21,033
By Looking Glass?

953
01:19:22,656 --> 01:19:24,419
A favorite of your mom's.

954
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,081
Yes. Yeah, it was.

955
01:19:27,191 --> 01:19:29,815
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

956
01:19:29,924 --> 01:19:31,254
Perhaps its very greatest.

957
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:32,806
Yeah, yes!

958
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:37,091
You know, Peter, you and I, we're...
we're the sailer in that song.

959
01:19:38,896 --> 01:19:44,391
He came on a summer's day.
Bringing gifts from far away.

960
01:19:45,002 --> 01:19:48,644
Like the child I put
in your mother.

961
01:19:48,769 --> 01:19:51,490
Or the freedom you brought Gamora.

962
01:19:53,861 --> 01:19:57,246
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

963
01:19:57,357 --> 01:20:00,195
What a good wife you would be.

964
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:07,641
My life, my love,
my lady, is the sea.

965
01:20:08,506 --> 01:20:10,917
The sea calls the sailor back.

966
01:20:11,028 --> 01:20:13,579
And he loves the girl, but
that's not his place.

967
01:20:14,297 --> 01:20:19,083
The sea calls upon him as
history calls upon great men.

968
01:20:19,838 --> 01:20:23,614
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

969
01:20:24,371 --> 01:20:27,066
Well, you may not be
mortal, but me...

970
01:20:27,211 --> 01:20:28,038
No, Peter.

971
01:20:28,182 --> 01:20:30,625
Death will remain a
stranger to both of us...

972
01:20:31,239 --> 01:20:33,429
...as long as the light
burns in this planet.

973
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:35,626
- I'm immortal?
- Mm-hm.

974
01:20:37,758 --> 01:20:39,196
Really?

975
01:20:39,303 --> 01:20:42,253
Yes!
As long as this light exists.

976
01:20:43,726 --> 01:20:47,608
And I can use the light to
build cool things, like...

977
01:20:47,715 --> 01:20:49,589
...how you made this whole planet?

978
01:20:49,734 --> 01:20:52,287
Well, it may take you a few
million years of practice...

979
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,278
...before you get
really good at it.

980
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:56,287
But, yes!

981
01:20:56,359 --> 01:20:58,152
What?

982
01:20:58,301 --> 01:21:01,212
This is...! Well, get ready for
an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man...

983
01:21:01,325 --> 01:21:02,439
...with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

984
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,166
Whatever you want.

985
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:05,050
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

986
01:21:05,202 --> 01:21:08,543
You know, Peter, it is
a tremendous responsibility.

987
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:11,637
Only we can remake the universe.

988
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:15,155
Only we can take the
bridle of the cosmos...

989
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:17,457
...and lead it to
where it needs to go.

990
01:21:19,401 --> 01:21:20,126
How?

991
01:21:31,866 --> 01:21:33,067
Come with me.

992
01:21:44,177 --> 01:21:45,614
Drax. Drax.

993
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,498
Drax! Drax!
We need to talk.

994
01:21:50,954 --> 01:21:52,213
I'm sorry.

995
01:21:53,257 --> 01:21:55,382
But I like a woman with
some meat on her bones.

996
01:21:55,463 --> 01:21:56,191
What?

997
01:21:56,335 --> 01:22:00,690
I tried to let you down easily by
telling you I found you disgusting.

998
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,094
No, that's not why...

999
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:07,233
What are you doing?

1000
01:22:08,746 --> 01:22:11,128
I'm imagining being with you.

1001
01:22:11,129 --> 01:22:11,884
Drax, that's not...

1002
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:14,367
I don't like you like that.

1003
01:22:14,475 --> 01:22:17,018
I don't even know the
type of thing you are.

1004
01:22:17,089 --> 01:22:19,778
Hey!
There's no need to get personal.

1005
01:22:19,855 --> 01:22:23,203
Listen!
Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1006
01:22:23,311 --> 01:22:24,826
I should have told you earlier.

1007
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,324
I is stupid.
You are in danger.

1008
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:36,316
What is that?

1009
01:22:39,185 --> 01:22:44,036
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

1010
01:22:44,148 --> 01:22:48,586
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1011
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:51,034
...everything is temporary.

1012
01:22:51,827 --> 01:22:54,570
We are forever.

1013
01:22:55,294 --> 01:22:56,655
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1014
01:22:56,769 --> 01:22:58,822
Not if you have a purpose, Peter.

1015
01:22:58,897 --> 01:23:00,981
Which is why you're here.

1016
01:23:01,706 --> 01:23:04,148
I told you how all those years ago...

1017
01:23:04,263 --> 01:23:08,324
...I had an unceasing
impulse to find life.

1018
01:23:08,971 --> 01:23:13,233
But what I did not tell you
is how I finally did find it.

1019
01:23:14,424 --> 01:23:15,973
It was all so...

1020
01:23:17,919 --> 01:23:19,508
...disappointing.

1021
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:23,623
And that is when I came...

1022
01:23:24,343 --> 01:23:29,086
...to a profound realization.

1023
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:34,653
My innate desire to
seek out other life...

1024
01:23:35,514 --> 01:23:39,936
...was not so that I
could walk among that life.

1025
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:43,431
Peter.

1026
01:23:44,842 --> 01:23:48,939
I have found meaning.

1027
01:24:07,069 --> 01:24:08,043
I see it.

1028
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:11,933
Eternity.

1029
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:13,838
Oh my god.

1030
01:24:24,306 --> 01:24:25,745
We need to get off this planet.

1031
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:40,042
Oh man.

1032
01:24:40,155 --> 01:24:42,959
Anyway, before I was so
rudely interrupted.

1033
01:24:43,068 --> 01:24:45,878
At that time, I was
a Federal Express man.

1034
01:24:56,279 --> 01:24:58,222
What the hell you doing, boy?

1035
01:24:58,366 --> 01:24:59,518
I could tell by how
you talked about him...

1036
01:24:59,626 --> 01:25:01,610
...this Ego is bad news.

1037
01:25:01,684 --> 01:25:03,371
We are here to save Quill.

1038
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,866
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

1039
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:09,599
No.
I don't care about those things.

1040
01:25:09,712 --> 01:25:12,478
I want to save Quill so I
can prove I'm better than him!

1041
01:25:12,587 --> 01:25:15,611
I can lord this
over him forever.

1042
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,741
What are you laughing
at me for?

1043
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:23,554
Oh, you can fool yourself and
everyone else, but you can't fool me.

1044
01:25:24,071 --> 01:25:25,264
I know who you are.

1045
01:25:25,409 --> 01:25:27,709
You do not know anything
about me, loser.

1046
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:29,834
I know everything about you.

1047
01:25:30,338 --> 01:25:32,508
I know you play like your the
meanest and the hardest...

1048
01:25:32,614 --> 01:25:34,549
...but actually you're the
most scared of all.

1049
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:35,473
Shut up!

1050
01:25:35,474 --> 01:25:37,373
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1051
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:39,821
...and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

1052
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,514
Because just a little bit of love...

1053
01:25:41,623 --> 01:25:45,041
...reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1054
01:25:45,117 --> 01:25:46,197
I said, shut up!

1055
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:49,611
I know them scientists what made
you never gave a rat's ass about you.

1056
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:50,946
I'm serious, dude.

1057
01:25:51,056 --> 01:25:52,613
Just like my own damn parents,
who sold me,...

1058
01:25:52,724 --> 01:25:56,158
...their own little
baby, into slavery.

1059
01:25:56,306 --> 01:25:58,535
I know who you are, boy.

1060
01:25:58,642 --> 01:26:00,082
Because you're me.

1061
01:26:06,527 --> 01:26:08,575
What kind of a pair are we

1062
01:26:09,775 --> 01:26:12,616
The kinds that's about to
go fight a planet, I recon.

1063
01:26:12,724 --> 01:26:14,600
All right!
Okay.

1064
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,131
Wait.

1065
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:17,466
Fight a what?

1066
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:22,582
Who are you people?

1067
01:26:22,692 --> 01:26:23,841
What is this place?

1068
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:24,957
Gamora, let her go!

1069
01:26:25,068 --> 01:26:27,225
The bodies in the
caverns, who are they?

1070
01:26:27,822 --> 01:26:28,920
You are scared.

1071
01:26:32,307 --> 01:26:35,473
I call it, the Expansion.

1072
01:26:36,129 --> 01:26:38,139
It is my purpose.

1073
01:26:38,247 --> 01:26:43,458
Now, it is yours, as well.

1074
01:26:43,987 --> 01:26:45,404
It's beautiful.

1075
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:48,647
Over thousands of years...

1076
01:26:48,758 --> 01:26:52,134
...I implanted thousands
of extension of myself...

1077
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:54,193
...on thousands of worlds.

1078
01:26:54,645 --> 01:26:58,928
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

1079
01:26:59,034 --> 01:27:00,905
...to grow and spread...

1080
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:03,498
...covering all that exists...

1081
01:27:03,605 --> 01:27:07,547
...until everything is...

1082
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:09,846
...me.

1083
01:27:10,599 --> 01:27:12,001
What did she do to me?

1084
01:27:12,904 --> 01:27:14,774
She already told me everything.

1085
01:27:14,883 --> 01:27:16,934
I only had one problem.

1086
01:27:17,657 --> 01:27:21,934
A single Celestial doesn't have
enough power for such an enterprise.

1087
01:27:22,729 --> 01:27:24,850
But two Celestials...

1088
01:27:24,929 --> 01:27:28,083
...well, now, that just might do.

1089
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,970
The bodies...

1090
01:27:32,621 --> 01:27:34,164
...are his children.

1091
01:27:35,552 --> 01:27:36,905
Out of all my labors...

1092
01:27:37,055 --> 01:27:39,287
...the most beguiling
was attempting to...

1093
01:27:39,358 --> 01:27:42,018
...graft my DNA with
that of another species.

1094
01:27:42,127 --> 01:27:45,578
I hoped the result of such
a coupling would be...

1095
01:27:45,688 --> 01:27:47,162
...enough to power the Expansion.

1096
01:27:48,069 --> 01:27:51,124
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1097
01:27:51,237 --> 01:27:55,300
It broke the Ravager code, but
I compensated him generously, and...

1098
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:58,933
...to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1099
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,628
And that was true,
they never felt a thing.

1100
01:28:01,737 --> 01:28:04,795
But, one after the
other, they failed me.

1101
01:28:05,445 --> 01:28:08,147
Not one of them
carried the Celestial genes.

1102
01:28:09,457 --> 01:28:10,736
Until you, Peter.

1103
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:13,978
Out of all my spawn...

1104
01:28:14,668 --> 01:28:19,090
...only you carry the
connection to the light.

1105
01:28:19,235 --> 01:28:23,046
We need to find Peter now
and get off this damn planet.

1106
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:25,641
Ego will have brought
him to his side by now.

1107
01:28:25,751 --> 01:28:28,022
- He has a way.
- Then we just go.
- No!

1108
01:28:28,131 --> 01:28:30,969
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

1109
01:28:31,078 --> 01:28:31,979
...is yell at each other.

1110
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,240
You're not friends.

1111
01:28:33,347 --> 01:28:34,179
You're right.

1112
01:28:35,597 --> 01:28:36,625
We're family.

1113
01:28:38,241 --> 01:28:40,039
We leave noone behind.

1114
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:44,822
Except maybe you.

1115
01:28:45,688 --> 01:28:47,017
Thank you.

1116
01:28:47,132 --> 01:28:49,504
For the first time
in my existence...

1117
01:28:50,293 --> 01:28:53,016
...I am truly not alone!

1118
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:00,752
What is it, son?

1119
01:29:04,046 --> 01:29:05,007
My friends.

1120
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:10,730
Oh, no, you see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1121
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:12,563
Yes.

1122
01:29:12,678 --> 01:29:15,546
We are beyond such things.

1123
01:29:15,672 --> 01:29:16,558
Yes.

1124
01:29:20,114 --> 01:29:20,966
- Now...
- But my mother...

1125
01:29:23,704 --> 01:29:26,149
You said you loved my mother.

1126
01:29:26,256 --> 01:29:27,911
And that I did.

1127
01:29:29,385 --> 01:29:34,530
My River Lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1128
01:29:36,153 --> 01:29:39,354
I returned to Earth to
see her three times.

1129
01:29:39,461 --> 01:29:41,942
And I knew if returned a 4th...

1130
01:29:42,087 --> 01:29:43,562
...I'd never leave.

1131
01:29:44,608 --> 01:29:46,048
The Expansion...

1132
01:29:48,423 --> 01:29:52,180
...the reason for my very
existence would be over, so...

1133
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:59,071
...I did what I had to do.

1134
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:09,543
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1135
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:20,679
What?

1136
01:30:20,865 --> 01:30:22,442
Now, now, I know...

1137
01:30:22,586 --> 01:30:23,417
...that sounds bad.

1138
01:30:23,534 --> 01:30:25,440
Who in the hell
do you think you are?

1139
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:27,669
You killed my mother!

1140
01:30:27,744 --> 01:30:28,574
I tried...

1141
01:30:28,684 --> 01:30:30,231
...so hard...

1142
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:32,354
...to find the form...

1143
01:30:32,466 --> 01:30:35,308
...that best suited you...

1144
01:30:35,422 --> 01:30:37,688
...and this is
the thanks I get?

1145
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,606
You really need to grow up.

1146
01:30:45,955 --> 01:30:47,926
I wanted to do this together.

1147
01:30:48,899 --> 01:30:50,681
But I suppose you'll have to learn by
spending the next thousand years...

1148
01:30:50,794 --> 01:30:54,030
...as a battery.

1149
01:30:56,421 --> 01:30:58,252
Finally! Rocket?

1150
01:30:58,364 --> 01:31:01,312
Keep that transmitter
nearby so I can find you.

1151
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:04,512
We're in an old piece of construction
Wip and Yondu once used...

1152
01:31:04,622 --> 01:31:06,565
...to slice open the bank of A'askavaria.

1153
01:31:06,678 --> 01:31:07,613
Ego's unhinged.

1154
01:31:07,766 --> 01:31:08,952
I know.
Get ready.

1155
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:10,292
Cut him loose, Kraglin.

1156
01:31:29,967 --> 01:31:30,825
No.

1157
01:31:43,002 --> 01:31:48,798
My life, my love,
my lady, is the sea.

1158
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:51,532
Peter.

1159
01:31:52,472 --> 01:31:55,025
This is the sea.

1160
01:32:36,066 --> 01:32:37,645
Hey there, jackass!

1161
01:32:47,013 --> 01:32:48,088
- What is that?
- Whoa, it's ~?

1162
01:32:54,988 --> 01:32:57,246
Out of the way,
dumber, smaller Groot!

1163
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,615
I told you something
didn't feel right.

1164
01:33:03,722 --> 01:33:06,347
"I told you so?"
Just what I need to hear right now.

1165
01:33:06,455 --> 01:33:07,786
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1166
01:33:07,895 --> 01:33:09,839
Because of the unspoken thing.

1167
01:33:09,914 --> 01:33:11,531
There is no unspoken thing.

1168
01:33:11,603 --> 01:33:13,582
What are you doing?
You could have killed us all.

1169
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:15,344
Uh, "Thank you, Rocket?"

1170
01:33:15,451 --> 01:33:16,565
We had it under control.

1171
01:33:16,635 --> 01:33:18,970
We did not.
That is only an extension of...

1172
01:33:19,082 --> 01:33:19,877
...his true self.

1173
01:33:19,878 --> 01:33:20,878
He will be back soon.

1174
01:33:20,985 --> 01:33:22,278
What's Smurfette doing here?

1175
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:24,264
Whatever I need to do
to get a damn ride home.

1176
01:33:24,373 --> 01:33:25,565
She tried to murder me!

1177
01:33:25,677 --> 01:33:27,331
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1178
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:28,590
He's not a fox.

1179
01:33:28,697 --> 01:33:30,501
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a rabboon either.

1180
01:33:30,575 --> 01:33:31,693
I am Groot.

1181
01:33:31,802 --> 01:33:33,202
Raccoon.
Whatever.

1182
01:33:36,154 --> 01:33:37,328
How do we kill a Celestial?

1183
01:33:37,441 --> 01:33:38,473
There's a center to him.

1184
01:33:38,814 --> 01:33:42,591
His brain, his soul, whatever it is,
in some sort of protective shell.

1185
01:33:42,696 --> 01:33:43,599
It's in the caverns...

1186
01:33:43,712 --> 01:33:44,613
...below the surface.

1187
01:33:46,664 --> 01:33:47,600
Yondu?

1188
01:33:55,965 --> 01:33:57,370
Thrusters are out.

1189
01:33:57,478 --> 01:33:59,305
I guess I should be
glad I was a skinny kid.

1190
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:01,403
Otherwise you would've
delivered me to this maniac.

1191
01:34:01,499 --> 01:34:03,767
You still recon that's the
reason I kept you around, idiot?

1192
01:34:03,874 --> 01:34:05,638
That's what you
told me, you old doofus.

1193
01:34:05,746 --> 01:34:07,727
Well once I figured out what
happened to them other kids...

1194
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:09,020
...I wasn't just
gonna hand you over.

1195
01:34:09,164 --> 01:34:11,034
You said you were
gonna eat me.

1196
01:34:11,109 --> 01:34:12,400
That was being funny.

1197
01:34:12,475 --> 01:34:13,843
Not to me!

1198
01:34:13,987 --> 01:34:16,683
You people have issues.

1199
01:34:16,828 --> 01:34:18,097
Well of course I have issues.

1200
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:19,787
That's my freaking father!

1201
01:34:20,151 --> 01:34:21,753
Thrusters are back up.

1202
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:36,271
- We should be going up!
- We can't.

1203
01:34:36,381 --> 01:34:39,045
Ego wants to eradicate the
universe as we know it.

1204
01:34:39,152 --> 01:34:40,121
We have to kill him.

1205
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:40,989
Rocket!

1206
01:34:41,097 --> 01:34:41,861
Got it!

1207
01:34:54,358 --> 01:34:55,836
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1208
01:34:55,943 --> 01:34:57,147
I guess.

1209
01:34:57,255 --> 01:34:58,511
Awesome!

1210
01:35:00,264 --> 01:35:02,562
We're really gonna be
able to jack up our price...

1211
01:35:02,671 --> 01:35:04,011
...if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1212
01:35:04,114 --> 01:35:06,663
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1213
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:09,297
It was just a random thought,
man. I thought we were friends?

1214
01:35:09,405 --> 01:35:11,741
Of course, I care about
the planets and the buildings...

1215
01:35:11,814 --> 01:35:13,179
...and all the animals
on the planets.

1216
01:35:13,287 --> 01:35:14,303
And the people.

1217
01:35:14,415 --> 01:35:15,167
Meh.

1218
01:35:15,609 --> 01:35:19,061
The crabby puppy's so cute.
He makes me want to die!

1219
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:32,850
Soup! Soup!

1220
01:35:54,049 --> 01:35:54,844
Pilots...

1221
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,400
...release envoy units.

1222
01:35:58,116 --> 01:36:01,475
Our sensors detect a battery
below the surface of the planet.

1223
01:36:03,459 --> 01:36:04,430
Dive!

1224
01:36:19,465 --> 01:36:20,582
Um. Cap'n?

1225
01:36:20,728 --> 01:36:21,481
Cap'n?

1226
01:36:27,972 --> 01:36:29,763
Tell me, why'd Ego
want you here?

1227
01:36:29,836 --> 01:36:32,031
He needs my genetic
connection to the light...

1228
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,439
...to help destroy the universe.

1229
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:35,385
He tried to teach me how
to control the power.

1230
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:36,610
So, could you?

1231
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:37,806
A little.

1232
01:36:37,874 --> 01:36:39,129
I made a ball.

1233
01:36:39,241 --> 01:36:40,540
A ball?

1234
01:36:40,645 --> 01:36:43,705
I thought as hard as I could.
That's all that I could come up with.

1235
01:36:43,813 --> 01:36:44,577
You thought?

1236
01:36:44,682 --> 01:36:46,982
You think when I let
this arrow fly...

1237
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:48,066
...I use my head?

1238
01:37:00,448 --> 01:37:01,465
Woah.

1239
01:37:12,006 --> 01:37:13,064
There.

1240
01:37:13,171 --> 01:37:14,967
That's Ego's core.

1241
01:37:17,793 --> 01:37:19,631
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1242
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,396
I got it covered.

1243
01:37:28,836 --> 01:37:30,095
We must hurry.

1244
01:37:30,203 --> 01:37:32,577
It will not take Ego
long to find us.

1245
01:37:37,349 --> 01:37:38,717
Keep it steady.

1246
01:37:45,844 --> 01:37:48,270
We drill into the
center, we kill him!

1247
01:37:56,084 --> 01:37:57,064
Captain?

1248
01:37:57,175 --> 01:37:58,685
What is it, Kraglin?

1249
01:37:58,794 --> 01:38:01,418
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?

1250
01:38:01,527 --> 01:38:02,320
Yeah, why?

1251
01:38:03,592 --> 01:38:04,515
- Uhh...
- Oh hell!

1252
01:38:28,032 --> 01:38:30,163
Why aren't you firing the laser?

1253
01:38:30,273 --> 01:38:32,153
They blew up the generator.

1254
01:38:32,261 --> 01:38:34,995
I think I packed
a small detonator.

1255
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:37,401
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1256
01:38:37,509 --> 01:38:39,018
Well, we've got these.

1257
01:38:39,843 --> 01:38:42,216
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1258
01:38:42,328 --> 01:38:45,275
If it is, it'll
cause a chain reaction...

1259
01:38:45,388 --> 01:38:46,722
...throughout his
entire nervous system.

1260
01:38:46,723 --> 01:38:47,470
Meaning what?

1261
01:38:47,582 --> 01:38:49,914
Meaning the entire planet will explode.

1262
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,708
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1263
01:38:51,854 --> 01:38:53,618
I made the timer.

1264
01:38:54,555 --> 01:38:55,324
Go!

1265
01:39:11,228 --> 01:39:13,018
He's coming!

1266
01:39:14,779 --> 01:39:16,797
Didn't you say you
could make him sleep?

1267
01:39:16,942 --> 01:39:20,466
When he wants.
He's too powerful.

1268
01:39:20,573 --> 01:39:21,545
I can't!

1269
01:39:22,487 --> 01:39:24,031
You have to believe in yourself.

1270
01:39:24,142 --> 01:39:27,272
Because I believe in you.

1271
01:39:41,152 --> 01:39:42,192
Sleep!

1272
01:39:50,465 --> 01:39:52,231
I never thought she'd
be able to do it...

1273
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:54,804
...with as weak and
skinny as she appears to be.

1274
01:39:55,633 --> 01:39:58,614
I don't know how
long I can hold him.

1275
01:40:02,756 --> 01:40:04,412
The metal's too thick.

1276
01:40:04,561 --> 01:40:05,650
For the bomb to work,...

1277
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:08,910
...we actually need
to place it on Ego's core.

1278
01:40:08,918 --> 01:40:12,044
And our fat butts ain't
gonna fit through those tiny holes.

1279
01:40:12,154 --> 01:40:13,306
Well...

1280
01:40:16,187 --> 01:40:18,091
That's a terrible idea.

1281
01:40:18,199 --> 01:40:20,792
Which is the only kind
of idea we have left.

1282
01:40:20,902 --> 01:40:23,529
Unbelievable.

1283
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:26,846
Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that.

1284
01:40:27,672 --> 01:40:29,507
What a day.

1285
01:40:38,317 --> 01:40:42,305
All right, first you flick
this switch, then this switch.

1286
01:40:42,414 --> 01:40:43,244
That activates it.

1287
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:46,299
Then you push this button.

1288
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:48,997
Which will give you 5 minutes
to get out of there.

1289
01:40:49,689 --> 01:40:51,343
Now, whatever you do...

1290
01:40:51,453 --> 01:40:54,440
...don't push this button.

1291
01:40:54,547 --> 01:40:58,537
'Cause that will set off the bomb
immediately and we'll all be dead.

1292
01:40:58,647 --> 01:41:01,273
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1293
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:03,579
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1294
01:41:03,728 --> 01:41:06,061
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

1295
01:41:06,170 --> 01:41:07,648
- I am Groot.
- No!

1296
01:41:07,754 --> 01:41:10,525
No, that's the button that
will kill everyone!

1297
01:41:11,209 --> 01:41:12,181
Try again.

1298
01:41:15,225 --> 01:41:16,533
- I am Groot.
- Um-hmm.

1299
01:41:16,643 --> 01:41:18,584
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1300
01:41:19,174 --> 01:41:19,899
- I am Groot.
- No!

1301
01:41:20,009 --> 01:41:23,346
That's exactly what you just
said, how is that even possible?

1302
01:41:23,455 --> 01:41:25,162
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1303
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:26,151
Point to it.

1304
01:41:27,012 --> 01:41:28,273
No!

1305
01:41:28,418 --> 01:41:29,928
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1306
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,764
Shut up and
give me some tape!

1307
01:41:31,877 --> 01:41:33,637
Does anybody have
any tape out there?

1308
01:41:33,745 --> 01:41:35,074
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1309
01:41:35,182 --> 01:41:37,056
I don't have any tape.
Let me check.

1310
01:41:37,805 --> 01:41:40,501
Yo, Yondu...

1311
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:42,550
...do you have any... ouch!
Do you have any tape?

1312
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:46,823
Gamora?
You have the tape?

1313
01:41:47,618 --> 01:41:48,588
Tape!

1314
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:50,504
Ah, nevermind.

1315
01:41:52,093 --> 01:41:54,464
Drax?
Do you have any tape?

1316
01:41:55,296 --> 01:41:57,199
Yeah, Scotch tape would work.

1317
01:41:57,308 --> 01:42:00,472
Then why did you ask me if Scotch tape
would work if you don't have any?

1318
01:42:01,587 --> 01:42:02,900
Nobody has any tape!

1319
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,897
Not a single person has tape?

1320
01:42:04,898 --> 01:42:05,615
Nope.

1321
01:42:05,727 --> 01:42:07,019
Did you ask Nebula?

1322
01:42:07,775 --> 01:42:08,671
Yes!

1323
01:42:08,782 --> 01:42:09,968
Are you sure?

1324
01:42:10,076 --> 01:42:12,163
I asked Yondu and she was
sitting right next to him.

1325
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:13,500
I knew you're lying!

1326
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:16,749
You have priceless batteries and
an atomic bomb in your bag.

1327
01:42:16,857 --> 01:42:18,048
If anybody's gonna
have tape, it's you!

1328
01:42:18,156 --> 01:42:21,879
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1329
01:42:21,984 --> 01:42:23,638
You are wasting
a lot of time here!

1330
01:42:29,863 --> 01:42:31,090
We're all gonna die.

1331
01:42:33,283 --> 01:42:35,619
Ah, rear thrusters are out again!

1332
01:42:35,728 --> 01:42:37,630
We're done for
without that generator!

1333
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:51,776
Guardians.

1334
01:42:52,496 --> 01:42:54,296
Perhaps it will
provide you solace...

1335
01:42:54,441 --> 01:42:56,768
...that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1336
01:42:56,914 --> 01:42:58,821
They will serve as a warning...

1337
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:00,729
...for all of those
tempted to betray us.

1338
01:43:01,454 --> 01:43:04,292
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1339
01:43:08,077 --> 01:43:08,977
This is gonna hurt.

1340
01:43:09,093 --> 01:43:10,316
Promises, promises.

1341
01:43:21,045 --> 01:43:22,128
No!

1342
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,333
No! No! No!

1343
01:43:40,205 --> 01:43:41,772
We're gonna blow!

1344
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:48,897
Peter!
No!

1345
01:44:07,444 --> 01:44:08,387
- Ha ha!
- What?

1346
01:44:08,532 --> 01:44:10,150
You look like Mary Poppins.

1347
01:44:10,463 --> 01:44:11,791
Is he cool?

1348
01:44:13,304 --> 01:44:15,067
Hell yeah, he's cool.

1349
01:44:16,005 --> 01:44:17,875
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1350
01:44:43,498 --> 01:44:45,213
Mantis!
Look out!

1351
01:44:56,896 --> 01:44:58,025
She's just unconscious.

1352
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:16,556
How long 'til the
bomb goes off?

1353
01:45:16,668 --> 01:45:19,339
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1354
01:45:19,448 --> 01:45:20,883
...about 6 minutes.

1355
01:45:26,093 --> 01:45:29,043
Kraglin, we need the
quadrant for an extraction.

1356
01:45:29,186 --> 01:45:30,077
T-minus 5 minutes.

1357
01:45:30,226 --> 01:45:31,096
Aye, captain.

1358
01:45:35,539 --> 01:45:38,163
Somebody's gotta be on
top when Kraglin arrives.

1359
01:45:38,887 --> 01:45:40,647
Drax, take Mantis.

1360
01:45:43,778 --> 01:45:44,689
Ow! My nipples!

1361
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:47,600
Ahhh!

1362
01:45:53,425 --> 01:45:54,483
Gamora!

1363
01:45:58,914 --> 01:46:00,194
Peter!

1364
01:46:28,092 --> 01:46:29,281
Get over it.

1365
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:33,682
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1366
01:46:36,494 --> 01:46:40,838
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1367
01:47:12,176 --> 01:47:13,623
Yeah!

1368
01:47:14,527 --> 01:47:18,724
Soon, Peter,
we will be all there is.

1369
01:47:18,834 --> 01:47:23,003
So stop pissing me off!

1370
01:47:43,799 --> 01:47:46,028
We have to get up
to the extraction point.

1371
01:47:54,096 --> 01:47:55,627
Go!

1372
01:50:02,187 --> 01:50:03,638
I told you...

1373
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:07,638
...I don't want
to do this alone.

1374
01:50:11,674 --> 01:50:13,397
You can not deny...

1375
01:50:13,509 --> 01:50:17,322
...the purpose the
universe has bestowed upon you.

1376
01:50:25,023 --> 01:50:27,319
Everyone, I need you
to stay back, it's not safe...

1377
01:50:27,432 --> 01:50:28,433
What is that?

1378
01:50:42,859 --> 01:50:44,905
It doesn't need to
be like this, Peter.

1379
01:50:45,873 --> 01:50:49,111
Why are you destroying
our chance?

1380
01:50:51,807 --> 01:50:54,973
Stop pretending you
aren't what you are.

1381
01:50:56,857 --> 01:50:58,008
One in billions.

1382
01:50:58,662 --> 01:51:00,818
Trillions. Even more.

1383
01:51:02,794 --> 01:51:07,408
What greater meaning
can a life possibly have to offer?

1384
01:51:09,348 --> 01:51:13,374
I don't use my head
to fly the arrows, boy!

1385
01:51:13,484 --> 01:51:15,896
I use my heart.

1386
01:51:47,969 --> 01:51:51,315
You shouldn't have killed my
mom and squished my Walkman.

1387
01:52:28,986 --> 01:52:31,752
Groot! Groot, if you can
hear me, hurry up!

1388
01:52:31,861 --> 01:52:34,919
I'm not sure how long
Quill can keep him distracted!

1389
01:52:34,995 --> 01:52:36,141
Groot, hurry!

1390
01:53:28,031 --> 01:53:30,370
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1391
01:53:30,477 --> 01:53:31,485
Get to the ship!

1392
01:53:31,592 --> 01:53:32,960
Not without Quill!

1393
01:53:33,072 --> 01:53:34,871
You need to take care of the twig!

1394
01:53:36,138 --> 01:53:37,507
Not without you.

1395
01:53:38,914 --> 01:53:41,611
I ain't got nothing right
my whole damn life, rat.

1396
01:53:45,049 --> 01:53:46,176
You need to give me this.

1397
01:53:56,458 --> 01:53:58,398
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1398
01:53:59,016 --> 01:54:00,419
I only have one of each.

1399
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,245
I...

1400
01:54:12,032 --> 01:54:14,011
I am Groot!

1401
01:54:14,394 --> 01:54:15,581
What's that?

1402
01:54:16,947 --> 01:54:21,121
He says, Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy.

1403
01:54:21,235 --> 01:54:23,394
Only he didn't use frickin'.

1404
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:30,670
Bye, twig.

1405
01:54:32,188 --> 01:54:35,063
We're gonna have to have a real
discussion about your language.

1406
01:55:34,868 --> 01:55:35,667
Where's Peter?

1407
01:55:36,802 --> 01:55:38,012
Rocket, where is he?

1408
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,475
Rocket?

1409
01:55:40,619 --> 01:55:42,559
Rocket, look at me!
Where is he?

1410
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:52,270
No, I'm not
leaving without him.

1411
01:55:59,579 --> 01:56:00,800
I'm sorry.

1412
01:56:01,699 --> 01:56:04,327
I can only afford to
lose one friend today.

1413
01:56:05,404 --> 01:56:07,024
Kraglin, go!

1414
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:07,994
Wait.

1415
01:56:08,932 --> 01:56:10,441
Let's hold back.

1416
01:56:12,602 --> 01:56:14,795
Rocket, where's Quill?

1417
01:56:16,629 --> 01:56:19,292
Rocket, where's Quill?

1418
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:22,236
Rocket!

1419
01:56:23,893 --> 01:56:25,439
Where's Quill?

1420
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:28,754
Where's Quill?

1421
01:56:38,104 --> 01:56:39,950
No, we need to stop it.

1422
01:56:40,058 --> 01:56:41,387
We need to stop it.

1423
01:56:48,884 --> 01:56:49,875
Stop, listen!
Listen to me.

1424
01:56:50,023 --> 01:56:51,577
You are a god.

1425
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:54,209
If you kill me...

1426
01:56:55,035 --> 01:56:57,407
...you'll be just
like everybody else.

1427
01:56:58,923 --> 01:57:00,863
What's wrong with that?

1428
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:02,018
No!

1429
01:57:57,088 --> 01:58:01,011
He may have been your father,
boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

1430
01:58:05,659 --> 01:58:08,402
I'm sorry I didn't
do none of it right.

1431
01:58:09,237 --> 01:58:11,453
Damn lucky you my boy.

1432
01:58:15,694 --> 01:58:16,951
What?

1433
01:58:30,356 --> 01:58:31,676
Yondu, what are you doing?

1434
01:58:31,785 --> 01:58:32,900
You can't.

1435
01:58:34,699 --> 01:58:35,887
Yondu!

1436
01:58:42,859 --> 01:58:43,682
No.

1437
01:58:47,497 --> 01:58:48,212
No!

1438
01:58:51,434 --> 01:58:52,406
No!

1439
01:58:52,514 --> 01:58:53,734
Oh no!

1440
01:59:49,478 --> 01:59:51,135
I told Gamora...

1441
01:59:51,278 --> 01:59:55,017
...how when I was a kid, I used to
pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1442
01:59:57,215 --> 02:00:00,320
He is a singer and actor
from Earth, really famous guy.

1443
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:03,478
Earlier, it struck me...

1444
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:08,875
...Yondu didn't have a talking car
but he did have a flying arrow.

1445
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:11,648
He didn't have the beautiful
voice of an angel...

1446
02:00:11,755 --> 02:00:13,268
...but he did have
the whistle of one.

1447
02:00:14,033 --> 02:00:17,664
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1448
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:19,356
...and hooked up with hot women...

1449
02:00:20,219 --> 02:00:21,662
...and fought robots.

1450
02:00:24,456 --> 02:00:28,172
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind
of end up being my dad after all.

1451
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:30,367
Only, it was you, Yondu.

1452
02:00:36,161 --> 02:00:38,061
I had a pretty cool dad.

1453
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:42,523
What I'm trying to say here is...

1454
02:00:44,285 --> 02:00:48,888
...sometimes the thing you're
searching for your whole life...

1455
02:00:51,045 --> 02:00:53,598
...it's right there
by your side all along.

1456
02:00:53,705 --> 02:00:55,068
You don't even know it.

1457
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:08,540
I am Groot.

1458
02:01:09,659 --> 02:01:11,599
He did call you twig.

1459
02:01:13,855 --> 02:01:14,844
Nebula.

1460
02:01:19,888 --> 02:01:21,756
I was a child like you.

1461
02:01:22,986 --> 02:01:26,687
I was concerned with staying
alive until the next day, every day.

1462
02:01:26,796 --> 02:01:29,602
And I never considered what
Thanos was doing to you.

1463
02:01:30,222 --> 02:01:31,437
I'm trying to make it right.

1464
02:01:31,834 --> 02:01:33,382
There are little girls
like you across the universe...

1465
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:34,861
...who are in danger.

1466
02:01:34,937 --> 02:01:40,337
You can stay with
us and help them.

1467
02:01:41,093 --> 02:01:42,953
I will help them
by killing Thanos.

1468
02:01:43,096 --> 02:01:44,862
I don't know if
that's possible.

1469
02:01:59,664 --> 02:02:01,455
You will always be my sister.

1470
02:02:45,456 --> 02:02:46,700
Pete!

1471
02:02:49,403 --> 02:02:51,341
The captain found this
for you in a junker shop,...

1472
02:02:51,449 --> 02:02:53,249
...said you'd come
back to the fold someday.

1473
02:02:55,842 --> 02:02:56,848
What is it?

1474
02:02:57,315 --> 02:02:58,142
It's called a Zune.

1475
02:02:58,215 --> 02:03:00,225
It's what everybody's listening
to on Earth nowadays.

1476
02:03:00,723 --> 02:03:02,162
It's got 300 songs on it.

1477
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:04,099
300 songs?

1478
02:03:09,693 --> 02:03:10,451
Wait.

1479
02:03:17,349 --> 02:03:19,268
Rocket grabbed the
pieces and re-assembled it.

1480
02:03:19,341 --> 02:03:21,174
But I think Yondu would
want you to have it.

1481
02:03:25,423 --> 02:03:26,227
Thanks.

1482
02:03:28,607 --> 02:03:29,436
Cap'n.

1483
02:04:43,944 --> 02:04:45,324
They came.

1484
02:04:53,871 --> 02:04:54,925
What is it?

1485
02:04:56,045 --> 02:04:58,670
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies.

1486
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,313
Told them what he did.

1487
02:05:04,133 --> 02:05:05,603
It's a Ravager funeral.

1488
02:05:23,991 --> 02:05:26,552
Yea! Yes!

1489
02:05:34,577 --> 02:05:36,520
He didn't let as down after all, Captain.

1490
02:05:37,323 --> 02:05:39,072
No, he did not.

1491
02:05:39,976 --> 02:05:41,774
He did not.

1492
02:05:49,113 --> 02:05:52,089
Fare thee well, old friend.

1493
02:05:54,464 --> 02:05:58,632
Yondu Udonta, I will
see you in the stars.

1494
02:06:03,582 --> 02:06:05,202
He didn't chase them away.

1495
02:06:05,626 --> 02:06:06,541
No.

1496
02:06:08,089 --> 02:06:09,381
Even though he yelled at 'em.

1497
02:06:10,497 --> 02:06:12,483
And was always mean.

1498
02:06:14,616 --> 02:06:16,916
And he stole batteries
he didn't need.

1499
02:06:22,357 --> 02:06:23,686
Well of course not.

1500
02:06:49,214 --> 02:06:50,011
What?

1501
02:06:51,197 --> 02:06:52,208
It's just...

1502
02:06:55,123 --> 02:06:56,489
...some unspoken thing.

1503
02:07:07,062 --> 02:07:08,573
It's beautiful.

1504
02:07:10,985 --> 02:07:11,743
Yes.

1505
02:07:13,799 --> 02:07:14,714
And so are you.

1506
02:07:17,625 --> 02:07:19,061
On the inside.

1507
02:07:49,517 --> 02:07:53,926
<i>THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY
WILL RETURN.</i>
