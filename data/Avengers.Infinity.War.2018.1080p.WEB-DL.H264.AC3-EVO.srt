<i>I repeat,

<i>Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.</i>

<i>We have
very few soldiers here.</i>

12

<i>This is not a warcraft.</i>

13
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:55,550
<i>I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.</i>

14
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:11,941
Hear me and rejoice.

15
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:18,031
You have had the privilege

16
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:20,784
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

17
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,914
You may think
this is suffering.

18
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:28,291
No.

19
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,586
It is salvation.

20
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:39,344
Universal scales
tip toward balance

21
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:40,929
because of your sacrifice.

22
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:44,057
Smile.

23
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,519
For even in death,

24
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,896
you have become
Children of Thanos.

25
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:07,455
I know what it's like to lose.

26
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:12,585
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

27
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:15,964
yet to fail, nonetheless.

28
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,765
It's frightening.

29
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,977
Turns the legs to jelly.

30
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:33,398
But I ask you, to what end?

31
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,402
Dread it, run from it...

32
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,864
destiny arrives all the same.

33
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:43,908
And now, it's here.

34
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:46,453
Or should I say...

35
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:49,330
I am.

36
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:55,962
You talk too much.

37
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,049
The Tesseract.

38
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:01,343
Or your brother's head.

39
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,391
I assume you have
a preference.

40
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,894
Oh, I do.

41
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,356
Kill away.

42
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,663
All right, stop!

43
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,461
We don't have the Tesseract.

44
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,088
It was destroyed on Asgard.

45
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:51,851
You really are
the worst brother.

46
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,942
I assure you, brother...

47
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:01,027
the sun will shine
on us again.

48
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:06,157
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

49
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:10,245
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

50
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:11,454
And for another...

51
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:15,041
we have a Hulk.

52
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:29,055
Let him have his fun.

53
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:22,859
Allfathers...

54
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:27,947
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

55
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:29,908
time.

56
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:46,132
That was a mistake.

57
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,807
No!

58
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,610
You're going to die for that.

59
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:09,864
Shh.

60
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,623
My humble personage...

61
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,168
bows before your grandeur.

62
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,134
No other being
has ever had the might...

63
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:31,177
nay, the nobility...

64
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:35,932
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

65
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,857
The universe lies
within your grasp.

66
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,857
There are two more stones
on Earth.

67
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:31,071
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

68
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,739
Father,
we will not fail you.

69
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:35,241
If I might interject.

70
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:39,412
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

71
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:42,248
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

72
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:44,751
If you consider
failure experience.

73
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:47,379
I consider
experience experience.

74
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,382
Almighty Thanos...

75
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:55,095
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

76
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,100
Odinson...

77
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:05,980
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

78
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,400
god of mischief...

79
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:10,902
do hereby pledge to you...

80
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:16,116
my undying fidelity.

81
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,169
Undying?

82
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:35,176
You should choose your words
more carefully.

83
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:57,157
You...

84
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,951
will never be...

85
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:03,830
a god.

86
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:15,050
No!

87
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:32,442
No resurrections this time.

88
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,259
No. Loki.

89
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,176
<i>Seriously,
you don't have any money?</i>

90
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:43,346
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

91
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:44,931
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.

92
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:46,933
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

93
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,935
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

94
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,103
Dollars?

95
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:52,022
- Rupees.
- Which is?

96
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,481
Uh, buck and a half.

97
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:55,358
What do you want?

98
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:57,485
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

99
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,042
Thanos is coming.

100
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:13,877
He's coming.

101
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:19,257
Who?

102
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:29,392
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

103
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,560
You're totally rambling.

104
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,478
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

105
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:32,937
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

106
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,147
and in the dream
you gotta pee.

107
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:35,315
- Yeah.
- Okay.

108
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:36,274
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.

109
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:37,650
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

110
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,943
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

111
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:39,986
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."

112
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:41,154
And then you wake up
and in real life

113
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:42,238
you actually have to pee.

114
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:43,323
- Yes.
- Yeah.

115
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:44,532
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

116
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,576
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

117
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:50,580
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

118
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:52,707
It was so real.

119
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:54,250
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

120
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,377
Uh, what was his name?

121
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:57,712
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

122
00:11:57,712 --> 00:11:59,547
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

123
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:01,341
...and thought that we were...

124
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:02,509
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

125
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:03,385
- Yes?
- No.

126
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:05,220
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

127
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,222
If you wanted to have a kid...

128
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,307
you wouldn't have done that.

129
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:11,351
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

130
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,019
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

131
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,396
You're not helping
your case, okay?

132
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:15,647
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

133
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,482
You don't need that.

134
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,608
I know, I had the surgery.

135
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,026
I'm just
trying to protect us...

136
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:21,653
and future usses
and that's it.

137
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,363
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

138
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:25,323
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

139
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,493
You know me so well.

140
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:31,705
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

141
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:33,581
You should have shirts
in your closet.

142
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:35,750
Yeah.

143
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,669
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

144
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,170
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

145
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,297
Show off this Harry Winston.

146
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,717
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

147
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:45,051
I should promise you.

148
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:46,302
- Yes.
- I will.

149
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,764
Thank you.

150
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:50,974
Tony Stark.

151
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:54,227
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

152
00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:59,065
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

153
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:01,026
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

154
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:03,194
We need your help.

155
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,738
It's not overselling it
to say that

156
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:06,531
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

157
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,074
And who's "we"?

158
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:11,036
Hey, Tony.

159
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:12,162
Bruce.

160
00:13:12,162 --> 00:13:13,663
- Pepper.
- Hi.

161
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,376
- Oh.
- You okay?

162
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:22,422
At the dawn
of the universe,

163
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,382
there was nothing. Then...

164
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:26,551
Boom.

165
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:30,138
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

166
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:33,016
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

167
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:35,560
These Infinity Stones

168
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,480
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

169
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:40,607
Space.

170
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:43,026
Reality.

171
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:45,653
Power.

172
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,156
Soul.

173
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,408
Mind.

174
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:53,536
And Time.

175
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:04,464
Tell me his name again.

176
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:05,799
Thanos.

177
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,300
He's a plague, Tony.

178
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,302
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

179
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:11,554
He wipes out
half the population.

180
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,807
He sent Loki.

181
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:16,768
The attack on New York,
that's him.

182
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:18,520
This is it.

183
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:20,647
What's our timeline?

184
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:23,233
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

185
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,150
That already makes him

186
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,860
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

187
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,406
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

188
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:30,532
He could destroy life

189
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,701
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

190
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,703
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

191
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,871
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

192
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:38,498
Is that what it is?

193
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,211
I'm going to allow that.

194
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,840
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

195
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,466
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

196
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:49,676
No can do.

197
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:52,512
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

198
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:53,763
And I swore off dairy...

199
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:56,391
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

200
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,892
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

201
00:14:57,892 --> 00:14:59,519
A bit chalky.

202
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,312
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

203
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:02,480
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

204
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,565
Point is, things change.

205
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,693
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

206
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,862
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

207
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:09,738
Yeah, so conversely,

208
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,865
it may also be
his best chance against us.

209
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,533
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

210
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:14,576
What is your job exactly?

211
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:16,286
Besides making
balloon animals.

212
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,165
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.

213
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:22,709
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

214
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,669
The fact is
we have this stone.

215
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,379
We know where it is.

216
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:28,798
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

217
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:30,550
and we have to find him now.

218
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:32,802
Yeah, that's the thing.

219
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:33,803
What do you mean?

220
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:36,348
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

221
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:37,515
He's offline.

222
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:38,850
- What?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,894
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

224
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:43,438
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

225
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:44,814
Who could find Vision then?

226
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,569
Shit.

227
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:50,695
Probably Steve Rogers.

228
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:51,821
Oh, great.

229
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:53,573
Maybe.

230
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,241
But...

231
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,746
Call him.

232
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:02,832
It's not that easy.

233
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,793
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

234
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:05,877
No.

235
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,587
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

236
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:09,381
Broke up?

237
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:13,343
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?

238
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:15,261
Cap and I fell out hard.

239
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:17,430
We're not on speaking terms.

240
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:21,393
Tony, listen to me.

241
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:23,728
Thor's gone.

242
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,523
Thanos is coming.

243
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,400
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

244
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,626
Flip phone.

245
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:08,940
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

246
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,275
moving your hair, would ya?

247
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:13,445
Not at the moment, no.

248
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,854
You okay?

249
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:50,065
- Help him!
- Banner!

250
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:51,858
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

251
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:52,942
Friday, what am I looking at?

252
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:54,569
<i>Not sure.
I'm working on it.</i>

253
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:56,654
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

254
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:57,989
in your back pocket, Doc!

255
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,366
Might wanna use it.

256
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,062
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

257
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:30,814
Holy shit.

258
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:32,524
We're all gonna die!

259
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:33,817
There's a spaceship!

260
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,652
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

261
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,370
What's the matter
with you kids?

262
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,997
You never seen
a spaceship before?

263
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:01,720
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

264
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:02,887
Notify first responders.

265
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,014
<i>Will do.</i>

266
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,462
Hear me and rejoice.

267
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,173
You are about to die

268
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:40,467
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

269
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:43,053
Be thankful...

270
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:45,972
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

271
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:48,933
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

272
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,811
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

273
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:53,897
Stonekeeper.

274
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:56,441
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

275
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:58,610
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

276
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,987
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

277
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:03,656
He means get lost, Squidward.

278
00:20:03,656 --> 00:20:04,866
He exhausts me.

279
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,951
Bring me the stone.

280
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,996
Banner, you want a piece?

281
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:12,540
Mmm, no, not really.

282
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,917
But when do I ever get
what I want?

283
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:14,918
That's right.

284
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:16,961
Okay. Push!

285
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:18,672
It's been a while.

286
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:20,215
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

287
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:21,383
Okay. Shh.

288
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:24,219
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

289
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:25,720
Come on, come on, man.

290
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,931
God!

291
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,475
Where's your guy?

292
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:33,186
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

293
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:34,562
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

294
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:35,980
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

295
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:44,322
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

296
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:46,574
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

297
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:47,534
It's okay.

298
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:50,078
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

299
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:51,538
- I have him.
- Damn it.

300
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:20,567
Where'd that come from?

301
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:21,651
<i>It's nanotech.</i>

302
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:22,694
<i>You like it?
A little something I...</i>

303
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:28,825
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend

304
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:30,035
won't be joining us...

305
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:41,046
<i>Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.</i>

306
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:42,547
It stays with me.

307
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:43,548
Exactly. Bye.

308
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:54,642
Tony, you okay?

309
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:56,686
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- <i>Really, really good.</i>

310
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:57,896
<i>Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?</i>

311
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:59,147
I'm trying. He won't come out.

312
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:02,108
<i>Hammer.</i>

313
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:12,952
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

314
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:15,205
Come out! Come out! Come out!

315
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:17,582
No!

316
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:23,088
What do you mean, "no"?

317
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,762
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

318
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:33,598
- <i>Kid, where'd you come from?</i>
- A field trip to MoMA.

319
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,976
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

320
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:38,978
Uh, he's from space.

321
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:41,231
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

322
00:23:07,882 --> 00:23:09,801
Your powers are quaint.

323
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:11,636
You must be popular
with children.

324
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:16,349
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

325
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:18,810
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

326
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:36,786
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

327
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:38,413
You'll only wish
you were dead.

328
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:49,716
No!

329
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,388
<i>Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.</i>

330
00:23:55,388 --> 00:23:57,015
On it!

331
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:05,857
Not cool.

332
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,071
Gotcha!

333
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:13,239
Wait!

334
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:24,084
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.

335
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:25,335
<i>Hang on, kid.</i>

336
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:42,394
Oh!

337
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:45,271
Ugh.

338
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:47,065
<i>Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.</i>

339
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:55,824
Give me a little juice,
Friday.

340
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:06,167
Unlock 17:A.

341
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:20,932
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

342
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:23,309
But you said
save the wizard!

343
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:24,436
I can't breathe.

344
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:27,272
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

345
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:30,442
Yeah. That makes sense.

346
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,961
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

347
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:50,962
<i>Happy trails, kid.</i>

348
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,380
- <i>Friday, send him home.</i>
- <i>Yep.</i>

349
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,924
Oh, come on!

350
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:05,393
<i>Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.</i>

351
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:06,436
<i>Tony? Oh, my God.</i>

352
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:07,479
<i>Are you all right?
What's going on?</i>

353
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,563
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think</i>

354
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:10,398
<i>we might have to push
our 8:30 res.</i>

355
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:11,524
<i>Why?</i>

356
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:13,193
<i>Just 'cause
I'll probably</i>

357
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:15,820
<i>not make it back for a while.</i>

358
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,072
<i>Tell me
you're not on that ship.</i>

359
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:18,323
Yeah.

360
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,532
<i>God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.</i>

361
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:21,326
Honey, I'm sorry.

362
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:22,369
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

363
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:24,079
<i>Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.</i>

364
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,247
- Pep.
- <i>Come back here right now.</i>

365
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:27,290
<i>Come back.</i>

366
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,043
<i>Boss,
we're losing her.</i>

367
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:31,503
<i>I'm going too.</i>

368
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:41,971
Oh, my God!

369
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,311
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

370
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,327
Where you going?

371
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:05,954
The Time Stone's been taken.

372
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:07,872
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

373
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:09,958
What will you do?

374
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,335
I'm gonna make a call.

375
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:53,918
Sing it, Drax!

376
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:08,016
Why are we doing this again?

377
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:09,601
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.

378
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:10,935
Someone could be dying.

379
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:13,104
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

380
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:15,106
'Cause we're nice.

381
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,149
And maybe whoever it is

382
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:18,026
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

383
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:20,445
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

384
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:22,322
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...

385
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:23,490
We take his ship.

386
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,283
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

387
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,284
All right!

388
00:28:29,537 --> 00:28:31,456
We are arriving.

389
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:32,499
All right, Guardians,

390
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:33,958
don't forget
this might be dangerous...

391
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,169
so let's put on
our mean faces.

392
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,093
Groot, put that
thing away, now.

393
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:44,135
I don't wanna tell you again.

394
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,387
Groot.

395
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:46,554
I am Groot!

396
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:47,639
- Whoa!
- Language!

397
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,265
- Hey!
- Wow.

398
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:51,142
You got some
acorns on you, kid.

399
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:52,644
Ever since
you got a little sap,

400
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:54,604
you're a total d-hole.

401
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:57,982
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

402
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:06,366
What happened?

403
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:11,663
Oh, my God.

404
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:19,170
Looks like
we're not getting paid.

405
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,466
Wipers! Wipers!

406
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:24,676
Get it off.

407
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,352
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

408
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:36,354
He is not a dude.

409
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:38,231
You're a dude.

410
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:41,568
This... This is a man.

411
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:44,529
A handsome, muscular man.

412
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:45,572
I'm muscular.

413
00:29:45,572 --> 00:29:46,656
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

414
00:29:46,656 --> 00:29:48,199
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

415
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:49,200
Yeah, right.

416
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,744
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

417
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:51,953
What?

418
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,041
Gamora, do you think I'm...

419
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:02,088
He is anxious, angry.

420
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:05,717
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

421
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:08,553
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

422
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:09,554
Wow.

423
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:11,723
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

424
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:14,642
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

425
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:15,727
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

426
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:17,354
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

427
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:18,563
It's like his muscles

428
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:20,648
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

429
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,400
Stop massaging his muscles.

430
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:25,236
Wake him up.

431
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,574
Wake.

432
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,219
Who the hell are you guys?

433
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:55,684
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

434
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:57,519
To bring balance
to the universe

435
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,605
by wiping out
half of all life.

436
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:02,816
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

437
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:04,567
massacre by massacre.

438
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,194
Including my own.

439
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:07,779
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

440
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,157
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

441
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:13,785
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

442
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:17,622
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

443
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,712
Your father killed my brother.

444
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,463
Oh, boy.

445
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,340
Stepfather, technically.

446
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,300
And she hates him
as much as you do.

447
00:31:32,846 --> 00:31:34,639
Families can be tough.

448
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,141
Before my father died,

449
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:37,892
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

450
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:40,437
that he imprisoned in Hel.

451
00:31:40,437 --> 00:31:43,523
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

452
00:31:43,523 --> 00:31:44,899
So I had to kill her.

453
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,193
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

454
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:48,403
Goes round and round and...

455
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,405
I feel your pain.

456
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:52,782
I feel your pain as well,
because...

457
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,159
I mean,
it's not a competition,

458
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,410
but I've been through a lot.

459
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,287
My father killed my mother.

460
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:58,455
And then I had to kill
my father.

461
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:00,165
That was hard.

462
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:03,501
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

463
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:06,546
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

464
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:08,340
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

465
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:13,678
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

466
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:16,389
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

467
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:19,768
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

468
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:22,103
No, you're not.

469
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:28,693
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

470
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:32,197
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

471
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:35,784
- No.
- You are.

472
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:38,703
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

473
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,163
No, I'm not.

474
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:42,207
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

475
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:49,714
Are you mocking me?

476
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:53,218
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

477
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:54,302
He's trying to copy me.

478
00:32:54,302 --> 00:32:55,428
I need you to stop doing that.

479
00:32:55,428 --> 00:32:57,263
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

480
00:32:57,263 --> 00:32:58,723
We need to stop Thanos.

481
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:00,392
Which means
we need to find out

482
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:01,559
where he's going next.

483
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,894
Knowhere.

484
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:04,729
He must be going somewhere.

485
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:06,898
No, no. Knowhere?

486
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:09,734
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

487
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,612
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

488
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:15,907
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

489
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,367
Because for years...

490
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:19,536
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

491
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:21,204
with a man
called the Collector.

492
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:22,831
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

493
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:24,749
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

494
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:26,376
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

495
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:28,920
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

496
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,548
There are six stones
out there.

497
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:33,883
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

498
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:37,679
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

499
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,848
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

500
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:42,726
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

501
00:33:42,726 --> 00:33:44,477
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

502
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:45,729
They're with the Avengers.

503
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,273
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

504
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:49,524
Like Kevin Bacon?

505
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:50,817
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

506
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:51,901
I haven't been there
in a while.

507
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:54,446
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

508
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:56,281
No one even knows where it is.

509
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:57,949
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

510
00:33:57,949 --> 00:33:59,659
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

511
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:02,329
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

512
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:03,496
You're welcome.

513
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:04,789
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

514
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:08,918
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

515
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,920
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

516
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,299
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

517
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:15,967
That place is a legend.

518
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,552
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

519
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:19,721
to ever torment the universe.

520
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:21,890
I would very much like
to go there, please.

521
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,974
The rabbit is correct

522
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:24,059
and clearly the smartest
among you.

523
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:25,101
Rabbit?

524
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:27,771
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

525
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,064
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

526
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:30,398
You're very perceptive.

527
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:31,608
You seem like a noble leader.

528
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:33,443
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

529
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:36,404
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

530
00:34:36,404 --> 00:34:38,323
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

531
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:39,491
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

532
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:40,700
Quiet.

533
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,369
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

534
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:43,995
Look, this is my ship.

535
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:46,790
And I'm not goin' to...

536
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:49,000
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

537
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,086
The Thanos-killing kind.

538
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:52,796
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

539
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:55,006
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

540
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:56,299
Your bodies would crumble

541
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:57,592
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

542
00:34:57,592 --> 00:34:59,636
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

543
00:34:59,678 --> 00:35:00,929
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

544
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:02,389
If we don't go to Knowhere

545
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:04,015
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

546
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:05,767
he'll be too powerful to stop.

547
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:08,019
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

548
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:09,854
We got two ships

549
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,481
and a large assortment
of morons.

550
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:14,818
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

551
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:16,027
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

552
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:17,821
to try to stop Thanos.

553
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,906
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

554
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:21,950
For the record...

555
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,493
I know that
you're going with him

556
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:24,661
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

557
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:26,329
You know, you really shouldn't

558
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,456
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

559
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,126
Come on, Groot.

560
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:33,962
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

561
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,677
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

562
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:41,761
Bye.

563
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,069
Vis?

564
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,113
Is it the stone again?

565
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:01,823
It's as if
it's speaking to me.

566
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:05,035
What does it say?

567
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:07,495
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

568
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:10,874
Hey.

569
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:23,345
Tell me what you feel.

570
00:36:30,143 --> 00:36:32,937
I just feel you.

571
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:43,114
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

572
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:45,450
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

573
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,951
What if
I miss that train?

574
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,078
There's an 11:00.

575
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,622
What if I missed
all the trains?

576
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,833
What if this time
I didn't go back?

577
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,418
But you gave Stark your word.

578
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,586
I'd rather give it to you.

579
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:58,797
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

580
00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:00,215
We both made promises.

581
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:01,966
Not to each other.

582
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:04,469
Wanda.

583
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:06,888
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

584
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:09,057
trying to see
if this could work and...

585
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:10,850
I don't know.

586
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,894
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

587
00:37:12,894 --> 00:37:14,854
I think...

588
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:16,064
- It works.
- It works.

589
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:17,482
It works.

590
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,069
Stay.

591
00:37:21,987 --> 00:37:23,738
Stay with me.

592
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:31,746
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

593
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:40,839
What are they?

594
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:43,174
What the stone
was warning me about.

595
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:54,686
I have to go.

596
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:56,187
No, Vision.

597
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:57,647
Vision, if that's true,

598
00:37:57,689 --> 00:38:00,483
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

599
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:02,736
Wanda, I...

600
00:38:02,736 --> 00:38:04,779
Vision!

601
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:36,561
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

602
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:38,521
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

603
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:42,108
My systems are failing.

604
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:44,861
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

605
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,490
Vis!

606
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,919
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

607
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:40,125
Hands off.

608
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:57,308
Come on. Come on.

609
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:59,269
Come on, you gotta get up.

610
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:01,646
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

611
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:04,357
Hey. We have to go.

612
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:08,778
Please. Please leave.

613
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:10,613
You asked me to stay.

614
00:40:11,781 --> 00:40:12,949
- I'm staying.
- Please.

615
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:26,022
- Get up.
- I can't.

616
00:41:26,022 --> 00:41:28,900
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

617
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,027
You'll never get
the chance again.

618
00:41:47,043 --> 00:41:48,920
Can you stand?

619
00:41:53,258 --> 00:41:54,801
Thank you, Captain.

620
00:41:57,387 --> 00:41:59,055
Let's get you on the jet.

621
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:06,521
Now, I thought we had a deal.

622
00:42:06,521 --> 00:42:10,400
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

623
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,027
I'm sorry.

624
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:13,862
We just wanted time.

625
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:17,824
Where to, Cap?

626
00:42:20,493 --> 00:42:22,078
Home.

627
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:27,876
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

628
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:53,443
<i>Zehobereians.</i>

629
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:55,362
Mother! Where's my mother?

630
00:42:55,362 --> 00:42:56,946
<i>Choose a side or die.</i>

631
00:42:56,946 --> 00:42:58,448
Mother!

632
00:42:58,448 --> 00:43:00,950
<i>One side
is a revelation...</i>

633
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,953
<i>the other an honor
known only to a few.</i>

634
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:06,956
What's wrong, little one?

635
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:10,293
My mother. Where is my mother?

636
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:16,299
What's your name?

637
00:43:17,592 --> 00:43:19,928
Gamora.

638
00:43:19,928 --> 00:43:22,013
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.

639
00:43:23,473 --> 00:43:24,974
Come.

640
00:43:24,974 --> 00:43:25,975
Let me help you.

641
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:40,490
Look.

642
00:43:44,202 --> 00:43:46,538
Pretty, isn't it?

643
00:43:46,538 --> 00:43:50,250
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

644
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,045
Too much to one side
or the other...

645
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:00,927
Here. You try.

646
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:07,809
<i>Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.</i>

647
00:44:09,185 --> 00:44:11,062
Uh-uh.

648
00:44:13,023 --> 00:44:14,524
Concentrate.

649
00:44:17,402 --> 00:44:20,238
There. You've got it.

650
00:44:29,664 --> 00:44:30,915
Gamora.

651
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,043
Do you know if these grenades

652
00:44:33,043 --> 00:44:35,378
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

653
00:44:35,378 --> 00:44:36,546
Because I was thinking about

654
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:38,256
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

655
00:44:38,256 --> 00:44:39,382
But I don't want to
if they're the...

656
00:44:39,382 --> 00:44:40,592
I need to ask a favor.

657
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:43,011
Yeah, sure.

658
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:45,555
One way or another,

659
00:44:45,555 --> 00:44:47,974
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.

660
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:52,103
Which is what
the grenades are for.

661
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:54,397
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

662
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,859
If things go wrong...

663
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:01,446
If Thanos gets me...

664
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:08,078
I want you to promise me...

665
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,205
you'll kill me.

666
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:11,998
What?

667
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:17,420
I know something he doesn't.

668
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,300
And if he finds it out,

669
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,593
the entire universe
could be at risk.

670
00:45:24,344 --> 00:45:25,553
What do you know?

671
00:45:25,553 --> 00:45:27,597
If I tell you, you'd know too.

672
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,560
If it's so important...

673
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,728
shouldn't I?

674
00:45:33,728 --> 00:45:34,896
Only if you wanna die.

675
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:36,898
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

676
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:39,234
Just...

677
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:44,698
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

678
00:45:44,698 --> 00:45:47,283
I mean, I'd like to.

679
00:45:47,283 --> 00:45:49,285
I really would. But you...

680
00:45:49,285 --> 00:45:50,453
Swear to me.

681
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:56,292
Swear to me on your mother.

682
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:04,300
Okay.

683
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,474
Okay.

684
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:28,783
- Oh.
- Dude.

685
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:30,493
How long have you been
standing there?

686
00:46:30,493 --> 00:46:31,494
An hour.

687
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,330
An hour?

688
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:35,332
Are you serious?

689
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,500
I've mastered the ability

690
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,253
of standing
so incredibly still...

691
00:46:41,421 --> 00:46:44,090
that I become
invisible to the eye.

692
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:45,592
Watch.

693
00:46:49,512 --> 00:46:51,556
You're eating a zarg-nut.

694
00:46:51,556 --> 00:46:53,099
But my movement...

695
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,477
was so slow...

696
00:46:56,353 --> 00:46:58,355
that it's imperceptible.

697
00:46:58,355 --> 00:46:59,189
Mmm, no.

698
00:46:59,189 --> 00:47:01,816
I'm sure I'm invisible.

699
00:47:01,816 --> 00:47:03,151
Hi, Drax.

700
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:06,696
Damn it.

701
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,551
This place looks deserted.

702
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:31,513
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

703
00:47:31,513 --> 00:47:33,431
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.

704
00:47:34,766 --> 00:47:36,351
Let's put down right here.

705
00:47:48,154 --> 00:47:49,572
I don't have it.

706
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,535
Everyone
in the galaxy knows

707
00:47:53,535 --> 00:47:55,203
you'd sell your own brother...

708
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:56,830
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

709
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,748
to your pathetic collection.

710
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:10,093
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

711
00:48:10,093 --> 00:48:13,471
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

712
00:48:16,683 --> 00:48:18,351
I told you.

713
00:48:19,185 --> 00:48:20,186
I sold it.

714
00:48:22,897 --> 00:48:25,233
Why would I lie?

715
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:27,402
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

716
00:48:28,278 --> 00:48:30,155
Like suicide.

717
00:48:30,155 --> 00:48:32,532
You do understand.

718
00:48:32,532 --> 00:48:35,660
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

719
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,454
I didn't know what it was.

720
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:40,457
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

721
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:41,583
It's him.

722
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,209
Last chance,
charlatan.

723
00:48:44,586 --> 00:48:46,671
Where's the stone?

724
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:48,214
Today...

725
00:48:48,214 --> 00:48:49,299
Drax. Drax.

726
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:51,384
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

727
00:48:51,384 --> 00:48:52,427
Drax, wait.

728
00:48:53,803 --> 00:48:55,472
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

729
00:48:55,472 --> 00:48:56,639
Drax.

730
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,896
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

731
00:49:02,896 --> 00:49:05,440
He doesn't have the stone yet.

732
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,817
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

733
00:49:07,817 --> 00:49:11,279
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

734
00:49:11,279 --> 00:49:12,489
No.

735
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:15,867
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

736
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:17,327
Sleep.

737
00:49:29,255 --> 00:49:30,382
Okay.

738
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:34,469
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

739
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:37,180
The other right.

740
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:03,206
Why?

741
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:17,220
Why you, daughter?

742
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:36,740
That was quick.

743
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:47,500
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

744
00:50:49,753 --> 00:50:52,547
<i>Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?</i>

745
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:58,261
<i>In my heart,
I knew you still cared.</i>

746
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,772
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

747
00:51:17,947 --> 00:51:20,784
<i>Reality is often
disappointing.</i>

748
00:51:23,953 --> 00:51:26,331
That is, it was.

749
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:29,668
Now...

750
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,506
reality can be
whatever I want.

751
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:37,634
You knew I'd come.

752
00:51:37,634 --> 00:51:39,969
I counted on it.

753
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:42,931
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

754
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,396
Thanos!

755
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:57,904
No!

756
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:04,452
Let her go, Grimace.

757
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:05,453
Peter.

758
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:07,998
I told you to go right.

759
00:52:08,665 --> 00:52:10,125
Now? Really?

760
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,002
You let her go!

761
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:13,878
Ah, the boyfriend.

762
00:52:13,878 --> 00:52:15,005
No.

763
00:52:15,005 --> 00:52:16,423
Like to think of myself

764
00:52:16,423 --> 00:52:18,925
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

765
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:21,094
- Let her go.
- Peter.

766
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:25,849
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

767
00:52:26,516 --> 00:52:27,934
Not him.

768
00:52:38,528 --> 00:52:42,073
You promised. You promised.

769
00:52:46,411 --> 00:52:47,954
Oh, daughter.

770
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:50,540
You expect too much from him.

771
00:52:54,044 --> 00:52:55,712
She's asked, hasn't she?

772
00:52:59,674 --> 00:53:00,675
Do it.

773
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:05,722
Mmm.

774
00:53:06,973 --> 00:53:08,475
Do it!

775
00:53:15,065 --> 00:53:16,608
I told you to go right.

776
00:53:18,568 --> 00:53:21,571
I love you more than anything.

777
00:53:24,658 --> 00:53:26,076
I love you too.

778
00:53:40,507 --> 00:53:41,549
I like him.

779
00:54:12,038 --> 00:54:14,165
<i>Still no word from Vision?</i>

780
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:17,585
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

781
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:18,795
<i>On a stolen Quinjet</i>

782
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:20,880
<i>with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.</i>

783
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,590
You know they're
only criminals because

784
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,134
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

785
00:54:24,134 --> 00:54:25,260
<i>My God, Rhodes.</i>

786
00:54:25,301 --> 00:54:28,888
<i>Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.</i>

787
00:54:28,888 --> 00:54:30,056
If it weren't
for those Accords,

788
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:32,142
Vision would've been
right here.

789
00:54:32,142 --> 00:54:35,520
<i>I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.</i>

790
00:54:35,937 --> 00:54:36,730
That's right.

791
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,942
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

792
00:54:40,942 --> 00:54:42,235
<i>You have second thoughts?</i>

793
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:43,987
Not anymore.

794
00:54:49,868 --> 00:54:51,536
Mr. Secretary.

795
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,709
<i>You got some nerve.</i>

796
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:00,086
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

797
00:55:00,086 --> 00:55:01,880
You could use
some of that right now.

798
00:55:02,756 --> 00:55:05,800
<i>The world's on fire.</i>

799
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,512
<i>And you think all is forgiven?</i>

800
00:55:09,512 --> 00:55:11,306
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

801
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:13,600
And I'm way past
asking permission.

802
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,979
Earth just lost
her best defender.

803
00:55:18,021 --> 00:55:19,147
So we're here to fight.

804
00:55:20,857 --> 00:55:22,776
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

805
00:55:23,777 --> 00:55:25,695
we'll fight you too.

806
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:29,908
<i>Arrest them.</i>

807
00:55:31,034 --> 00:55:32,661
All over it.

808
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:39,042
That's a court-martial.

809
00:55:41,628 --> 00:55:42,629
It's great to see you, Cap.

810
00:55:43,713 --> 00:55:45,590
You too, Rhodey.

811
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:46,591
Hey.

812
00:55:47,884 --> 00:55:50,095
Wow. You guys...

813
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,098
really look like crap.

814
00:55:53,098 --> 00:55:54,891
Must've been
a rough couple years.

815
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:58,019
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

816
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:00,146
Uh, I think
you look great.

817
00:56:03,608 --> 00:56:04,693
Uh...

818
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:09,239
Yeah, I'm back.

819
00:56:10,991 --> 00:56:11,992
Hi, Bruce.

820
00:56:17,622 --> 00:56:18,623
Nat.

821
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,586
This is awkward.

822
00:56:26,006 --> 00:56:27,757
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

823
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:29,050
And they can clearly find us.

824
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,636
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

825
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:33,096
After the whole
Accords situation,

826
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:34,848
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

827
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:36,391
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

828
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:37,934
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

829
00:56:37,934 --> 00:56:39,311
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

830
00:56:40,228 --> 00:56:41,271
Okay, look.

831
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:44,357
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

832
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:47,902
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

833
00:56:49,738 --> 00:56:50,905
Vision's stone.

834
00:56:50,947 --> 00:56:52,240
Then we have to protect it.

835
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,950
No, we have to destroy it.

836
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:57,412
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

837
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:58,747
to this entity in my head.

838
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:00,749
About its nature.

839
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:03,043
But also its composition.

840
00:57:03,043 --> 00:57:05,086
I think if it were exposed

841
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:07,088
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

842
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:10,967
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

843
00:57:12,635 --> 00:57:15,221
its molecular integrity
could fail.

844
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:17,974
Yeah, and you with it.

845
00:57:17,974 --> 00:57:19,684
We're not having
this conversation.

846
00:57:19,684 --> 00:57:21,770
Eliminating the stone
is the only way

847
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,189
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

848
00:57:24,189 --> 00:57:26,358
That's too high a price.

849
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:33,281
Only you have
the power to pay it.

850
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:39,829
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

851
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:42,415
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

852
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:43,958
But it should.

853
00:57:46,336 --> 00:57:47,962
We don't trade lives, Vision.

854
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:50,090
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

855
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,050
to save how many
millions of people?

856
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,219
Tell me,
why is this any different?

857
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:56,638
Because you might
have a choice.

858
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:59,224
Your mind is made up

859
00:57:59,224 --> 00:58:01,851
of a complex construct
of overlays.

860
00:58:01,851 --> 00:58:05,480
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

861
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,315
All of them mixed together,

862
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:09,234
all of them
learning from one another.

863
00:58:09,234 --> 00:58:11,152
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

864
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:14,364
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

865
00:58:14,364 --> 00:58:15,991
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

866
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:17,826
Perhaps the best parts.

867
00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:19,077
Can we do that?

868
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:21,871
Not me, not here.

869
00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:23,373
Well,
you better find someone

870
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:24,833
and somewhere fast.

871
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:26,209
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

872
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:27,377
have your old rooms back.

873
00:58:30,422 --> 00:58:32,090
I know somewhere.

874
00:58:46,813 --> 00:58:48,064
The Kingsguard

875
00:58:48,064 --> 00:58:49,441
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

876
00:58:49,441 --> 00:58:51,443
And the Border Tribe?

877
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:53,361
Those that are left.

878
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:55,780
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

879
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,907
M'Baku likes a good fight.

880
00:59:00,076 --> 00:59:02,370
And what of this one?

881
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,914
This one may be tired of war.

882
00:59:04,914 --> 00:59:07,959
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

883
00:59:30,482 --> 00:59:32,150
Where's the fight?

884
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:34,402
On its way.

885
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:55,423
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

886
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,302
I have never failed him.

887
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:07,602
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

888
01:00:07,602 --> 01:00:09,312
with the Time Stone
still attached

889
01:00:09,312 --> 01:00:11,606
to your vaguely
irritating person...

890
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:14,275
there would be judgment.

891
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:24,369
Give me...

892
01:00:28,248 --> 01:00:29,249
the stone.

893
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:43,179
Wow, you're a seriously

894
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:44,389
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

895
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:47,058
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...

896
01:00:47,058 --> 01:00:48,435
What the...

897
01:00:48,435 --> 01:00:50,145
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

898
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:51,146
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

899
01:00:51,146 --> 01:00:52,605
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

900
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:53,481
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

901
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:54,566
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

902
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:57,152
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

903
01:00:57,152 --> 01:00:58,278
God damn it.

904
01:00:58,278 --> 01:01:01,239
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

905
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:02,657
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

906
01:01:02,657 --> 01:01:04,200
And now, I'm here in space.

907
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,870
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

908
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:09,080
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

909
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,206
This is a one-way ticket.

910
01:01:10,206 --> 01:01:12,042
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

911
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:13,168
No, I did think this through.

912
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:14,961
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

913
01:01:14,961 --> 01:01:16,504
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

914
01:01:16,504 --> 01:01:18,173
if there's no neighborhood.

915
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,468
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

916
01:01:21,468 --> 01:01:22,927
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

917
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:28,933
Come on. We got a situation.

918
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,018
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

919
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,061
What's your plan?

920
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:32,187
- Go.
- Um...

921
01:01:32,937 --> 01:01:34,522
Okay, okay... Uh...

922
01:01:34,522 --> 01:01:37,942
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, <i>Aliens?</i>

923
01:01:41,446 --> 01:01:44,366
Painful, aren't they?

924
01:01:44,366 --> 01:01:48,036
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

925
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:50,121
And any one of them...

926
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:58,046
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

927
01:01:58,046 --> 01:01:59,673
<i>I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.</i>

928
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:02,384
<i>Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.</i>

929
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:06,930
You've saved nothing.

930
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,015
Your powers
are inconsequential

931
01:02:09,015 --> 01:02:10,517
compared to mine.

932
01:02:10,517 --> 01:02:12,227
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

933
01:02:26,366 --> 01:02:28,493
Yes! Wait.
What are those?

934
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:45,969
Hey,
we haven't officially met.

935
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,263
Cool.

936
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:51,766
We gotta turn
this ship around.

937
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:54,102
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

938
01:02:54,102 --> 01:02:55,562
No, I want to protect
the stone.

939
01:02:55,562 --> 01:02:56,980
And I want you
to thank me.

940
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,523
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

941
01:02:58,523 --> 01:03:01,443
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

942
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:03,778
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

943
01:03:03,778 --> 01:03:04,612
I seriously don't know

944
01:03:04,612 --> 01:03:05,780
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

945
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,616
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

946
01:03:08,616 --> 01:03:10,368
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

947
01:03:10,368 --> 01:03:12,454
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

948
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:14,164
And due to that fact,

949
01:03:14,164 --> 01:03:15,582
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

950
01:03:15,582 --> 01:03:17,459
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

951
01:03:17,459 --> 01:03:19,502
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

952
01:03:19,502 --> 01:03:20,587
The adults are talking.

953
01:03:20,587 --> 01:03:23,465
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

954
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:25,300
What is he, your ward?

955
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,676
No.

956
01:03:26,676 --> 01:03:28,720
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

957
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,472
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

958
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:33,600
I'm Spider-Man, then.

959
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,268
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

960
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:36,394
Thing's on autopilot.

961
01:03:36,394 --> 01:03:38,313
Can we control it?

962
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:40,231
Fly us home?

963
01:03:43,234 --> 01:03:44,361
- Stark?
- Yeah.

964
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:45,695
Can you get us home?

965
01:03:45,695 --> 01:03:47,113
Yeah, I heard you.

966
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:50,700
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

967
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:53,119
Under no circumstances

968
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,664
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

969
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,082
I don't think
you quite understand

970
01:03:57,082 --> 01:03:57,999
what's at stake here.

971
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:00,627
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

972
01:04:00,627 --> 01:04:03,546
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

973
01:04:03,546 --> 01:04:05,298
Since he sent an army
to New York

974
01:04:05,298 --> 01:04:07,050
and now he's back.

975
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,135
And I don't know what to do.

976
01:04:09,135 --> 01:04:10,261
So I'm not so sure

977
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:12,305
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

978
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:16,142
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

979
01:04:16,142 --> 01:04:18,436
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

980
01:04:18,436 --> 01:04:21,356
So I say we take
the fight to him.

981
01:04:21,356 --> 01:04:22,357
Doctor.

982
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,694
Do you concur?

983
01:04:28,238 --> 01:04:30,699
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

984
01:04:31,783 --> 01:04:34,160
But you have to understand...

985
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,745
if it comes to saving you

986
01:04:35,745 --> 01:04:38,456
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

987
01:04:38,456 --> 01:04:42,210
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

988
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:46,381
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

989
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:49,300
Nice. Good, moral compass.

990
01:04:50,552 --> 01:04:52,137
We're straight.

991
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:54,639
All right, kid.

992
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,100
You're an Avenger now.

993
01:05:33,595 --> 01:05:35,805
I thought
you might be hungry.

994
01:05:47,942 --> 01:05:49,736
I always hated that chair.

995
01:05:49,736 --> 01:05:52,489
So I've been told.

996
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:56,451
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

997
01:05:57,243 --> 01:05:58,662
I hated this room.

998
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:00,955
This ship.

999
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:02,791
I hated my life.

1000
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:09,506
You told me that too.

1001
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:14,135
Every day.

1002
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:18,765
For almost 20 years.

1003
01:06:21,393 --> 01:06:23,728
I was a child
when you took me.

1004
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:25,897
I saved you.

1005
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:30,318
No.

1006
01:06:31,903 --> 01:06:35,657
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1007
01:06:35,657 --> 01:06:37,409
Going to bed hungry...

1008
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:39,327
scrounging for scraps.

1009
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:42,288
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1010
01:06:42,288 --> 01:06:44,708
I'm the one who stopped that.

1011
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,710
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1012
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,920
The children born...

1013
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:52,549
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1014
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:53,758
It's a paradise.

1015
01:06:56,511 --> 01:06:58,513
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1016
01:06:58,513 --> 01:07:01,558
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1017
01:07:01,558 --> 01:07:02,684
You're insane.

1018
01:07:02,684 --> 01:07:04,811
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1019
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:08,273
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1020
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:12,610
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1021
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:13,820
It needs correction.

1022
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,322
You don't know that!

1023
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,617
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1024
01:07:19,617 --> 01:07:23,788
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1025
01:07:25,457 --> 01:07:26,458
For a time...

1026
01:07:28,918 --> 01:07:33,340
you had that same will...

1027
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,344
as you fought by my side.

1028
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:39,262
Daughter.

1029
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:41,723
I'm not your daughter.

1030
01:07:44,267 --> 01:07:46,895
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1031
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:49,314
And, in doing so,

1032
01:07:49,314 --> 01:07:51,524
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1033
01:07:54,444 --> 01:07:57,322
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1034
01:08:00,617 --> 01:08:03,495
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1035
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:07,290
I am disappointed.

1036
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,668
But not because
you didn't find it.

1037
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:14,923
But because you did.

1038
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:18,301
And you lied.

1039
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:36,486
Nebula.

1040
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,078
Don't do this.

1041
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,538
Some time ago,

1042
01:08:46,538 --> 01:08:49,416
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1043
01:08:49,457 --> 01:08:50,500
Please don't do this.

1044
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,752
And very nearly succeeded.

1045
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:54,838
So I brought her here.

1046
01:08:56,464 --> 01:08:57,674
To talk.

1047
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,726
Stop. Stop it.

1048
01:09:13,648 --> 01:09:16,484
I swear to you on my life.

1049
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:18,737
I never found the Soul Stone.

1050
01:09:22,824 --> 01:09:24,617
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

1051
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:26,036
<i>You know
what he's about to do.</i>

1052
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:28,830
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

1053
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,040
- <i>All of them.</i>
- <i>He can never get them all.</i>

1054
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,124
<i>He will!</i>

1055
01:09:31,124 --> 01:09:33,418
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

1056
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:35,837
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i>

1057
01:09:35,837 --> 01:09:38,673
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

1058
01:09:43,678 --> 01:09:45,513
You're strong.

1059
01:09:47,557 --> 01:09:48,558
Me.

1060
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:52,687
You're generous.

1061
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:54,981
Me.

1062
01:09:56,983 --> 01:09:59,653
But I never taught you to lie.

1063
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:02,364
That's why
you're so bad at it.

1064
01:10:04,532 --> 01:10:08,953
Where is the Soul Stone?

1065
01:10:26,471 --> 01:10:27,472
Vormir!

1066
01:10:45,573 --> 01:10:47,075
The stone is on Vormir.

1067
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:52,872
Show me.

1068
01:10:54,749 --> 01:10:56,126
I am Groot.

1069
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,502
Tinkle in the cup.

1070
01:10:57,502 --> 01:10:58,920
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1071
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,172
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

1072
01:11:01,172 --> 01:11:02,549
I am Groot.

1073
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:03,675
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1074
01:11:03,675 --> 01:11:05,510
out into space
and go in the cup again.

1075
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:06,594
You speak Groot?

1076
01:11:06,594 --> 01:11:08,763
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1077
01:11:08,763 --> 01:11:09,931
I am Groot.

1078
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:12,058
You'll know when we're close.

1079
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,810
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1080
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,979
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

1081
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:20,859
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

1082
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:23,445
It's truly awesome.

1083
01:11:29,284 --> 01:11:32,579
Okay, time to be the captain.

1084
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,753
So, dead brother, huh?

1085
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:42,005
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1086
01:11:42,005 --> 01:11:43,923
Well, he's been dead before.

1087
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,261
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

1088
01:11:48,303 --> 01:11:50,889
And you said
your sister and your dad?

1089
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,807
Both dead.

1090
01:11:52,807 --> 01:11:54,934
But still got a mom, though?

1091
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:56,269
Killed by a dark elf.

1092
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:57,604
A best friend?

1093
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:58,855
Stabbed through the heart.

1094
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:05,487
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1095
01:12:07,697 --> 01:12:09,199
Absolutely.

1096
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,952
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

1097
01:12:12,952 --> 01:12:14,663
they're all
tremendous motivators.

1098
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,789
They really clear the mind.

1099
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,041
So I'm good to go.

1100
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:20,752
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

1101
01:12:20,752 --> 01:12:23,129
he's the toughest there is.

1102
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:25,298
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

1103
01:12:25,298 --> 01:12:27,634
He's never fought me twice.

1104
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,552
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1105
01:12:29,552 --> 01:12:31,763
It better be some hammer.

1106
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:38,895
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1107
01:12:38,895 --> 01:12:41,064
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1108
01:12:41,064 --> 01:12:43,108
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1109
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:44,818
but none succeeded.

1110
01:12:44,859 --> 01:12:47,904
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1111
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:50,865
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1112
01:12:50,865 --> 01:12:52,909
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1113
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:54,828
Fate wills it so.

1114
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:56,162
Mmm-hmm.

1115
01:12:56,162 --> 01:12:58,039
And what if you're wrong?

1116
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,086
If I'm wrong, then...

1117
01:13:04,337 --> 01:13:05,964
what more could I lose?

1118
01:13:19,811 --> 01:13:21,187
I could lose a lot.

1119
01:13:21,187 --> 01:13:23,273
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

1120
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,111
Okay.

1121
01:13:31,197 --> 01:13:33,366
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

1122
01:13:33,366 --> 01:13:35,285
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

1123
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,746
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

1124
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,373
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

1125
01:13:40,373 --> 01:13:41,750
He gave you his eye?

1126
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,001
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1127
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,962
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1128
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,174
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1129
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,175
Hmm.

1130
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:54,220
Huh?

1131
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,349
Oh.

1132
01:13:57,349 --> 01:14:00,143
I would've washed that.

1133
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:02,812
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

1134
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:05,065
Hey, we're here!

1135
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:10,320
I don't think
this thing works.

1136
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,655
Everything seems dark.

1137
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,784
It ain't the eye.

1138
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,382
Something's wrong.

1139
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:32,842
The star's gone out.

1140
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,178
And the rings are frozen.

1141
01:14:56,282 --> 01:14:57,951
I hope
these dwarves are better

1142
01:14:57,951 --> 01:14:59,786
at forging
than they are cleaning.

1143
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,459
Maybe they realized
that they live

1144
01:15:06,459 --> 01:15:08,128
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

1145
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:11,131
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1146
01:15:13,341 --> 01:15:16,177
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

1147
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:17,470
Yes, why?

1148
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,681
It look
anything like that?

1149
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,978
I am Groot.

1150
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,354
Go back to the pod.

1151
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:31,401
Eitri, wait!

1152
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:33,403
Stop!

1153
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,322
Stop.

1154
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:37,115
Thor?

1155
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:42,203
What happened here?

1156
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:45,373
You were supposed
to protect us.

1157
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:48,209
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1158
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:50,378
Asgard is destroyed.

1159
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:56,468
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

1160
01:16:09,272 --> 01:16:12,275
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.

1161
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:16,696
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

1162
01:16:19,115 --> 01:16:20,492
I made what he wanted.

1163
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:26,706
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1164
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,838
Then he killed
everyone anyway.

1165
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:37,717
All except me.

1166
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:40,512
"Your life is yours," he said.

1167
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:46,893
"But your hands
are mine alone."

1168
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,895
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

1169
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,523
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

1170
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:53,191
every axe, hammer, sword...

1171
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:56,236
it's all inside your head.

1172
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:58,321
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1173
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:00,323
Trust me, I know.

1174
01:17:00,323 --> 01:17:05,078
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

1175
01:17:45,493 --> 01:17:48,079
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1176
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:50,248
I need you
to meet me on Titan.

1177
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,131
Hey, what's going on?

1178
01:17:58,131 --> 01:17:59,424
I think we're here.

1179
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:01,968
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1180
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:05,305
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

1181
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:06,306
Close those around it.

1182
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,225
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1183
01:18:09,225 --> 01:18:10,518
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

1184
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:12,270
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

1185
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,109
We might wanna turn.

1186
01:18:18,109 --> 01:18:19,319
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1187
01:18:49,265 --> 01:18:50,850
You all right?

1188
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,478
That was close.

1189
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,564
I owe you one.

1190
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:58,692
Let me just say, if aliens

1191
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,652
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

1192
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:01,695
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.

1193
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,406
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1194
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,157
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

1195
01:19:06,157 --> 01:19:07,534
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1196
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,126
Thanos!

1197
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,065
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

1198
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,944
Stay down, clown.

1199
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,201
Die, blanket of death!

1200
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,085
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

1201
01:20:00,253 --> 01:20:02,255
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.

1202
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,382
Where is Gamora?

1203
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:07,218
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

1204
01:20:07,218 --> 01:20:10,180
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

1205
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,182
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

1206
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,433
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

1207
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:17,062
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1208
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,648
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1209
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,775
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1210
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:24,152
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

1211
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,278
I'll kill all three of you

1212
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:27,280
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

1213
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,323
Starting with you.

1214
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,282
Wait, what, Thanos?

1215
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:32,118
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1216
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:33,787
What master do you serve?

1217
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,288
What master do I serve?

1218
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:36,623
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

1219
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:38,500
You're from Earth.

1220
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,417
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1221
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,378
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.

1222
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:42,545
What are you hassling us for?

1223
01:20:42,545 --> 01:20:44,339
So you're not
with Thanos?

1224
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:47,258
With Thanos?

1225
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:50,053
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1226
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,597
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1227
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:54,432
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.

1228
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:56,810
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1229
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,269
You know Thor?

1230
01:20:58,269 --> 01:20:59,229
Yeah.

1231
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:02,107
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1232
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,650
Where is he now?

1233
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,709
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1234
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,085
It's a mold.

1235
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,671
A king's weapon.

1236
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:27,632
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1237
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,677
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1238
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:32,220
Did it have a name?

1239
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,140
Stormbreaker.

1240
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,224
That's a bit much.

1241
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:39,352
So how do we make it?

1242
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:43,356
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1243
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:46,526
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1244
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:51,698
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1245
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,537
The hell happened
to this planet?

1246
01:21:57,537 --> 01:21:59,456
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

1247
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,624
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1248
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:06,713
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1249
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:09,549
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1250
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:10,884
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1251
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,385
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1252
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:13,720
pin him down,
get what we need.

1253
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,513
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1254
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:17,223
We just want the gauntlet.

1255
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,559
Are you yawning?

1256
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:21,853
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1257
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:23,688
Did you hear what I said?

1258
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:26,232
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1259
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:27,275
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1260
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:30,403
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1261
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,155
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1262
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:33,740
Kick names, take ass.

1263
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,158
Yeah, that's right.

1264
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:43,541
All right, just get over here,
please.

1265
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,585
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1266
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:47,754
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1267
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,883
We gotta coalesce.

1268
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:53,718
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1269
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:56,262
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1270
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:57,764
We don't know what it means.

1271
01:22:57,764 --> 01:23:00,558
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1272
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:03,269
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1273
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,313
and that way
it might be really good.

1274
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,440
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1275
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,651
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

1276
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,819
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

1277
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,779
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

1278
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,489
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1279
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:15,740
It never was.

1280
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:16,825
Don't encourage this,
all right?

1281
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,326
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

1282
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,869
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1283
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,621
By the way,
that's a compliment.

1284
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:23,373
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1285
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:24,791
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1286
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,293
that's 100% you.

1287
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:28,586
Your math
is blowing my mind.

1288
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:29,796
Excuse me.

1289
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:34,342
But does your friend
often do that?

1290
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,929
Strange, we all right?

1291
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:49,482
You're back. You're all right.

1292
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:51,693
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

1293
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:56,323
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1294
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:57,824
To see all
the possible outcomes

1295
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,701
of the coming conflict.

1296
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:01,911
How many did you see?

1297
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:04,331
14,000,605.

1298
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,375
How many did we win?

1299
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,340
One.

1300
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:38,239
The stone
had better be up there.

1301
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:41,993
For your sister's sake.

1302
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:07,727
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1303
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:13,316
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1304
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:14,567
You know us?

1305
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:19,614
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1306
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,366
Where is the Soul Stone?

1307
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:24,369
You should know...

1308
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:27,497
it extracts a terrible price.

1309
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:30,417
I am prepared.

1310
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,338
We all think that at first.

1311
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:42,012
We are all wrong.

1312
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,109
How is it you know
this place so well?

1313
01:25:56,109 --> 01:26:00,947
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1314
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,825
I even held one in my hand.

1315
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:07,996
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1316
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:12,042
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1317
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,762
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1318
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,806
As does what you fear.

1319
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,601
What's this?

1320
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,144
The price.

1321
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:36,858
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1322
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,945
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1323
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,449
Tell me what it needs.

1324
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,994
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1325
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:50,664
understands its power...

1326
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:55,543
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1327
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:57,504
Of what?

1328
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,547
In order to take the stone,

1329
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,883
you must lose
that which you love.

1330
01:27:04,844 --> 01:27:06,054
A soul...

1331
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:08,014
for a soul.

1332
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,032
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

1333
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,535
a moment...

1334
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,871
when you got
what you deserved.

1335
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,459
And I was always
so disappointed.

1336
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,506
But now...

1337
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:48,555
You kill and torture...

1338
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,517
and you call it mercy.

1339
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,648
The universe has judged you.

1340
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:04,696
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1341
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,741
You failed.

1342
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,910
And do you wanna know why?

1343
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:13,747
Because you love nothing.

1344
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,041
No one.

1345
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:22,881
No.

1346
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:28,595
Really?

1347
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:30,680
Tears?

1348
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:33,475
They're not for him.

1349
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:48,865
No.

1350
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:51,785
This isn't love.

1351
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:55,246
I ignored my destiny once.

1352
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,959
I cannot do that again.

1353
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:03,838
Even for you.

1354
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,323
I'm sorry, little one.

1355
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,578
No!

1356
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:16,054
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1357
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:17,389
I hope you're right
about this.

1358
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:20,308
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

1359
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,450
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda

1360
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,868
to the rest of the world...

1361
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:41,162
this is not what I imagined.

1362
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,248
And what did you imagine?

1363
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:44,708
The Olympics.

1364
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,292
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1365
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,100
Should we bow?

1366
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,768
Yeah, he's a king.

1367
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,770
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1368
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,107
What are you doing?

1369
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,234
Uh, we don't do that here.

1370
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:13,778
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1371
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,906
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

1372
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:17,949
How we looking?

1373
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,993
You will have my Kingsguard,

1374
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:23,955
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

1375
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:26,875
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.

1376
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:31,046
How you been, Buck?

1377
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:34,132
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.

1378
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:47,312
Whoa.

1379
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,939
The structure is polymorphic.

1380
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:53,151
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1381
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,111
Why didn't you just reprogram

1382
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:57,197
the synapses
to work collectively?

1383
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:01,993
Because we didn't think of it.

1384
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:03,370
I'm sure you did your best.

1385
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:05,497
Can you do it?

1386
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:09,042
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

1387
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:12,504
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1388
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:13,755
It will take time, brother.

1389
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,424
How long?

1390
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:17,842
As long as you can give me.

1391
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:24,516
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1392
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,827
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.

1393
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:54,838
God, I love this place.

1394
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:57,007
<i>Yeah, don't
start celebrating yet, guys.</i>

1395
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:58,925
<i>We got more incoming
outside the dome.</i>

1396
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:19,195
It's too late.

1397
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:22,073
We need to destroy
the stone now.

1398
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,908
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

1399
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,327
We will hold them off.

1400
01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:28,997
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1401
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:29,998
you blow it to hell.

1402
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:31,541
I will.

1403
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:34,377
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.

1404
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,546
And get this man a shield.

1405
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,224
<i>I don't think</i>

1406
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:49,601
<i>you get the scientifics here.</i>

1407
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:52,145
<i>These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...</i>

1408
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:53,521
<i>you're gonna need something
a lot bigger</i>

1409
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:54,898
<i>to yank 'em loose.</i>

1410
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:57,067
- Leave that to me.
- <i>Leave it to you?</i>

1411
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:00,236
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1412
01:35:08,495 --> 01:35:09,579
<i>Fire the engines!</i>

1413
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:29,891
More power, rabbit!

1414
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:03,091
Well done, boy.

1415
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:06,678
That's Nidavellir.

1416
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,241
Damn it.

1417
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:30,035
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1418
01:36:30,035 --> 01:36:31,411
<i>The mechanism
is crippled.</i>

1419
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:33,038
- What?
- With the iris closed,

1420
01:36:33,038 --> 01:36:34,205
I can't heat the metal.

1421
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:35,999
How long will it take
to heat it?

1422
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:38,293
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?

1423
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:41,463
I'm gonna hold it open.

1424
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:42,714
That's suicide.

1425
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:45,216
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1426
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,061
How we looking, Bruce?

1427
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:57,979
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

1428
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,360
Wow! This is amazing, man.

1429
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,362
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...

1430
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:11,326
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

1431
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:13,787
I've got two heat signatures

1432
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:14,996
breaking through
the tree line.

1433
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:46,069
Thank you
for standing with us.

1434
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:09,801
Where's your other friend?

1435
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:12,304
You will pay for his life
with yours.

1436
01:38:13,305 --> 01:38:16,308
Thanos will have that stone.

1437
01:38:16,308 --> 01:38:17,809
That's not gonna happen.

1438
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,353
You are in Wakanda now.

1439
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:23,732
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1440
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:29,112
We have blood to spare.

1441
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:41,833
They surrender?

1442
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:43,710
Not exactly.

1443
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,197
What the hell?

1444
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,743
Looks like we pissed her off.

1445
01:39:27,504 --> 01:39:29,130
They're killing themselves.

1446
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,876
You see the teeth
on those things?

1447
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:07,919
All right, back up, Sam.

1448
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:09,129
You're gonna get
your wings singed.

1449
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:22,934
<i>Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter</i>

1450
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,102
<i>and get in behind us...</i>

1451
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:26,438
<i>there's nothing
between them and Vision.</i>

1452
01:40:26,438 --> 01:40:28,440
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.

1453
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,691
How do we do that?

1454
01:40:31,985 --> 01:40:33,695
We open the barrier.

1455
01:40:35,905 --> 01:40:40,452
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.

1456
01:40:40,452 --> 01:40:42,454
<i>Requesting
confirmation, My King.</i>

1457
01:40:42,454 --> 01:40:44,289
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1458
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:45,665
On my signal.

1459
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:47,584
This will be
the end of Wakanda.

1460
01:40:48,835 --> 01:40:52,380
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

1461
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:06,811
Wakanda forever!

1462
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:20,283
Now!

1463
01:41:50,522 --> 01:41:52,023
How much longer, Shuri?

1464
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,775
I've barely begun, brother.

1465
01:41:53,775 --> 01:41:55,652
You might want to pick up
the pace.

1466
01:42:02,701 --> 01:42:04,703
Allfathers, give me strength.

1467
01:42:04,703 --> 01:42:06,705
You understand, boy?

1468
01:42:06,705 --> 01:42:09,708
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

1469
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:12,711
It'll kill you.

1470
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,879
Only if I die.

1471
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:16,715
Yes.

1472
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:19,551
That's what killing you means.

1473
01:42:47,537 --> 01:42:49,456
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1474
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:41,800
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1475
01:43:42,759 --> 01:43:43,760
Thor, you okay?

1476
01:43:49,474 --> 01:43:50,850
I think he's dying.

1477
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:52,811
He needs the axe!

1478
01:43:54,187 --> 01:43:55,647
Where's the handle?

1479
01:43:58,692 --> 01:44:00,986
Tree, help me find the handle!

1480
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:12,057
There's too many of 'em!

1481
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:41,962
You guys
are so screwed now!

1482
01:45:45,215 --> 01:45:47,258
Bring me Thanos!

1483
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,584
Oh, yeah.

1484
01:46:24,713 --> 01:46:26,715
You're much more of a Thanos.

1485
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:31,136
I take it the Maw is dead.

1486
01:46:33,346 --> 01:46:35,932
This day
extracts a heavy toll.

1487
01:46:37,684 --> 01:46:40,186
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1488
01:46:40,186 --> 01:46:41,813
You may regret that.

1489
01:46:42,647 --> 01:46:44,024
He brought you face-to-face

1490
01:46:44,024 --> 01:46:45,567
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.

1491
01:46:48,695 --> 01:46:51,072
And where do you think
he brought you?

1492
01:46:52,157 --> 01:46:54,909
Let me guess. Your home?

1493
01:46:59,205 --> 01:47:00,624
It was.

1494
01:47:03,251 --> 01:47:04,794
And it was beautiful.

1495
01:47:07,297 --> 01:47:09,966
Titan was like most planets.

1496
01:47:10,008 --> 01:47:13,011
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1497
01:47:13,011 --> 01:47:16,222
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1498
01:47:17,223 --> 01:47:19,142
Genocide.

1499
01:47:19,184 --> 01:47:23,229
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1500
01:47:24,689 --> 01:47:27,400
They called me a madman.

1501
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:29,819
And what I predicted
came to pass.

1502
01:47:32,364 --> 01:47:34,574
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.

1503
01:47:35,033 --> 01:47:36,326
I'm a survivor.

1504
01:47:36,368 --> 01:47:38,828
Who wants to murder trillions.

1505
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:43,041
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1506
01:47:43,041 --> 01:47:47,837
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1507
01:47:49,881 --> 01:47:51,299
And then what?

1508
01:47:52,759 --> 01:47:55,011
I'd finally rest...

1509
01:47:55,011 --> 01:47:59,224
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1510
01:47:59,224 --> 01:48:03,728
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1511
01:48:03,728 --> 01:48:08,316
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.

1512
01:48:09,859 --> 01:48:10,860
Our?

1513
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:18,368
Piece of cake, Quill.

1514
01:48:18,368 --> 01:48:20,787
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.

1515
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:00,285
Boom!

1516
01:49:00,285 --> 01:49:03,079
Don't let him close his fist.

1517
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:08,251
Magic.

1518
01:49:08,918 --> 01:49:09,919
More magic.

1519
01:49:10,795 --> 01:49:11,796
Magic with a kick.

1520
01:49:12,297 --> 01:49:13,298
Magic with a...

1521
01:49:14,758 --> 01:49:16,009
Insect!

1522
01:49:53,338 --> 01:49:54,798
Well, well.

1523
01:49:54,798 --> 01:49:55,966
You should've killed me.

1524
01:49:55,966 --> 01:49:57,801
It would've been
a waste of parts!

1525
01:50:03,223 --> 01:50:04,391
Where's Gamora?

1526
01:50:45,598 --> 01:50:46,975
<i>Is he under?
Don't let up.</i>

1527
01:50:46,975 --> 01:50:49,602
Be quick. He is very strong.

1528
01:50:49,602 --> 01:50:51,980
Parker, help! Get over here.

1529
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:54,232
<i>She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.</i>

1530
01:50:59,612 --> 01:51:00,947
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.

1531
01:51:00,947 --> 01:51:02,115
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.

1532
01:51:02,115 --> 01:51:03,283
For the record,
this was my plan.

1533
01:51:04,534 --> 01:51:06,328
You're not so strong now, huh?

1534
01:51:06,911 --> 01:51:08,580
Where is Gamora?

1535
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:10,874
My Gamora.

1536
01:51:10,874 --> 01:51:13,168
No, bullshit!

1537
01:51:13,168 --> 01:51:14,377
Where is she?

1538
01:51:15,462 --> 01:51:16,880
He is in anguish.

1539
01:51:17,464 --> 01:51:19,549
Good.

1540
01:51:19,549 --> 01:51:22,427
He... He mourns.

1541
01:51:22,427 --> 01:51:26,139
What does
this monster have to mourn?

1542
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:27,974
Gamora.

1543
01:51:31,895 --> 01:51:33,229
What?

1544
01:51:33,229 --> 01:51:35,315
He took her to Vormir.

1545
01:51:35,315 --> 01:51:37,275
He came back
with the Soul Stone.

1546
01:51:38,109 --> 01:51:39,527
But she didn't.

1547
01:51:41,446 --> 01:51:45,492
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1548
01:51:45,492 --> 01:51:49,079
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1549
01:51:50,246 --> 01:51:51,247
Tell me she's lying.

1550
01:51:53,625 --> 01:51:56,461
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!

1551
01:51:58,046 --> 01:52:01,383
I had to.

1552
01:52:02,175 --> 01:52:03,593
No, you didn't.

1553
01:52:03,593 --> 01:52:05,428
No, you didn't.

1554
01:52:09,265 --> 01:52:10,684
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1555
01:52:10,684 --> 01:52:13,269
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!

1556
01:52:13,269 --> 01:52:14,521
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

1557
01:52:14,521 --> 01:52:16,272
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!

1558
01:52:19,943 --> 01:52:20,944
Oh, God.

1559
01:53:19,336 --> 01:53:23,048
Come and get some,
space dogs!

1560
01:53:25,675 --> 01:53:28,511
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1561
01:53:28,511 --> 01:53:30,639
Come on! Get some!

1562
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:33,350
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1563
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:35,268
Okay. How much for the arm?

1564
01:53:37,187 --> 01:53:39,230
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1565
01:53:48,073 --> 01:53:49,366
New haircut?

1566
01:53:49,366 --> 01:53:50,617
Noticed you've copied
my beard.

1567
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:55,121
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.

1568
01:53:56,039 --> 01:53:57,999
I am Groot.

1569
01:53:58,792 --> 01:54:00,710
I am Steve Rogers.

1570
01:54:20,397 --> 01:54:22,565
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1571
01:54:32,075 --> 01:54:34,327
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.

1572
01:54:34,327 --> 01:54:35,412
I'm doing it.

1573
01:54:59,352 --> 01:55:01,062
Why was she up there
all this time?

1574
01:55:01,813 --> 01:55:04,733
She's on the field. Take it.

1575
01:55:36,431 --> 01:55:38,600
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.

1576
01:55:41,311 --> 01:55:43,438
Somebody get to Vision!

1577
01:55:43,438 --> 01:55:45,273
- <i>I got him!</i>
- On my way.

1578
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:53,573
He'll die alone. As will you.

1579
01:55:53,573 --> 01:55:54,824
She's not alone.

1580
01:56:21,184 --> 01:56:22,894
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

1581
01:56:22,894 --> 01:56:24,604
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

1582
01:56:24,604 --> 01:56:27,190
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

1583
01:56:27,190 --> 01:56:28,233
<i>What? No! No!</i>

1584
01:56:31,778 --> 01:56:34,531
<i>Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!</i>

1585
01:56:36,533 --> 01:56:38,285
Hulk? Hulk,

1586
01:56:38,285 --> 01:56:40,370
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

1587
01:56:40,370 --> 01:56:42,872
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1588
01:56:47,419 --> 01:56:48,878
Hulk! Hulk!

1589
01:56:49,754 --> 01:56:50,755
Hulk!

1590
01:56:51,881 --> 01:56:54,384
No!

1591
01:56:54,384 --> 01:56:57,304
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!

1592
01:56:57,304 --> 01:56:58,471
I'll do it myself!

1593
01:56:59,389 --> 01:57:01,266
<i>Come on! Yeah!</i>

1594
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:15,280
<i>See ya!</i>

1595
01:57:26,666 --> 01:57:29,336
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1596
01:57:40,305 --> 01:57:42,223
I thought you were formidable,
machine.

1597
01:57:42,974 --> 01:57:45,602
But you're dying,
like any man.

1598
01:57:54,277 --> 01:57:55,487
Get outta here!

1599
01:57:58,823 --> 01:57:59,866
Go!

1600
01:58:18,635 --> 01:58:20,387
That was really gross.

1601
01:58:47,497 --> 01:58:48,581
I thought I told you to go.

1602
01:58:50,041 --> 01:58:52,002
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1603
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:05,682
I got you. I got you.

1604
01:59:05,682 --> 01:59:07,684
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1605
01:59:52,896 --> 01:59:54,564
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1606
01:59:56,566 --> 01:59:59,486
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1607
02:00:02,822 --> 02:00:03,907
A fake.

1608
02:00:11,790 --> 02:00:15,502
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1609
02:00:15,502 --> 02:00:16,753
Stark.

1610
02:00:16,753 --> 02:00:17,837
You know me?

1611
02:00:18,546 --> 02:00:20,048
I do.

1612
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:23,385
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1613
02:00:24,094 --> 02:00:25,595
My only curse is you.

1614
02:00:28,056 --> 02:00:29,057
Come on!

1615
02:00:57,002 --> 02:00:58,962
All that for a drop of blood.

1616
02:01:43,006 --> 02:01:44,841
You have my respect, Stark.

1617
02:01:46,593 --> 02:01:49,763
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1618
02:01:55,185 --> 02:01:57,437
I hope they remember you.

1619
02:02:07,072 --> 02:02:08,198
Stop.

1620
02:02:14,621 --> 02:02:15,622
Spare his life...

1621
02:02:17,248 --> 02:02:19,042
and I will give you the stone.

1622
02:02:22,712 --> 02:02:23,922
No tricks.

1623
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:29,761
Don't.

1624
02:03:21,104 --> 02:03:22,897
One to go.

1625
02:03:32,782 --> 02:03:34,117
Where is he?

1626
02:03:43,126 --> 02:03:44,628
Did we just lose?

1627
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:50,300
Why would you do that?

1628
02:03:53,762 --> 02:03:55,972
We're in the endgame now.

1629
02:04:20,789 --> 02:04:23,333
Are you okay?

1630
02:04:25,251 --> 02:04:27,087
What? What is it?

1631
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:30,256
He's here.

1632
02:04:41,267 --> 02:04:44,312
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

1633
02:04:47,107 --> 02:04:49,067
What the hell?

1634
02:05:14,718 --> 02:05:15,719
Cap.

1635
02:05:16,303 --> 02:05:17,887
That's him.

1636
02:05:19,889 --> 02:05:22,350
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1637
02:05:46,958 --> 02:05:47,959
Wanda.

1638
02:05:49,044 --> 02:05:50,420
It's time.

1639
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:51,755
No.

1640
02:05:51,755 --> 02:05:54,049
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

1641
02:05:54,049 --> 02:05:55,717
Look at me.

1642
02:05:55,717 --> 02:05:56,926
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

1643
02:05:56,926 --> 02:05:58,011
Don't.

1644
02:05:58,011 --> 02:05:59,095
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1645
02:06:01,097 --> 02:06:03,767
We are out of time.

1646
02:06:04,392 --> 02:06:05,852
I can't.

1647
02:06:05,852 --> 02:06:07,187
Yes, you can.

1648
02:06:07,896 --> 02:06:09,105
You can.

1649
02:06:10,523 --> 02:06:12,942
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1650
02:06:15,236 --> 02:06:16,863
It's not fair.

1651
02:06:18,031 --> 02:06:19,699
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1652
02:06:21,451 --> 02:06:23,036
It's all right.

1653
02:06:24,371 --> 02:06:26,122
You could never hurt me.

1654
02:06:35,173 --> 02:06:37,008
I just feel you.

1655
02:08:00,133 --> 02:08:01,217
It's all right.

1656
02:08:11,186 --> 02:08:12,437
It's all right.

1657
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:17,984
I love you.

1658
02:08:47,222 --> 02:08:49,349
I understand, my child.

1659
02:08:50,976 --> 02:08:52,477
Better than anyone.

1660
02:08:54,229 --> 02:08:56,147
You could never.

1661
02:09:01,027 --> 02:09:04,030
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1662
02:09:05,657 --> 02:09:08,368
But now is no time to mourn.

1663
02:09:10,578 --> 02:09:14,582
Now is no time at all.

1664
02:09:38,023 --> 02:09:39,024
No!

1665
02:10:36,998 --> 02:10:38,375
I told you...

1666
02:10:39,709 --> 02:10:41,544
you'd die for that.

1667
02:10:56,017 --> 02:10:57,644
You should have...

1668
02:11:00,355 --> 02:11:01,690
You should...

1669
02:11:04,317 --> 02:11:07,529
You should have
gone for the head.

1670
02:11:09,447 --> 02:11:10,448
No!

1671
02:11:43,773 --> 02:11:45,150
Daughter?

1672
02:11:52,657 --> 02:11:54,159
Did you do it?

1673
02:11:56,077 --> 02:11:57,078
Yes.

1674
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:07,088
What did it cost?

1675
02:12:10,675 --> 02:12:12,260
Everything.

1676
02:12:22,479 --> 02:12:24,105
What did you do?

1677
02:12:25,315 --> 02:12:26,733
What'd you do?

1678
02:12:40,455 --> 02:12:41,748
Where'd he go?

1679
02:12:44,668 --> 02:12:45,835
Thor.

1680
02:12:49,172 --> 02:12:50,799
Where'd he go?

1681
02:12:50,799 --> 02:12:52,217
Steve?

1682
02:13:26,876 --> 02:13:29,796
Up, General. Up!

1683
02:13:29,796 --> 02:13:31,381
This is no place to die.

1684
02:13:46,354 --> 02:13:47,897
I am Groot.

1685
02:13:47,897 --> 02:13:49,524
Oh...

1686
02:13:50,442 --> 02:13:52,527
No, no, no!

1687
02:13:53,361 --> 02:13:56,239
Groot! No.

1688
02:14:09,586 --> 02:14:10,712
Sam!

1689
02:14:14,758 --> 02:14:16,468
Sam, where you at?

1690
02:14:25,727 --> 02:14:27,896
Something's happening.

1691
02:14:40,033 --> 02:14:41,368
Quill?

1692
02:14:48,667 --> 02:14:49,918
Steady, Quill.

1693
02:14:49,918 --> 02:14:51,252
Oh, man.

1694
02:14:55,382 --> 02:14:56,383
Tony.

1695
02:14:59,803 --> 02:15:02,389
There was no other way.

1696
02:15:07,936 --> 02:15:08,937
Mr. Stark?

1697
02:15:13,483 --> 02:15:14,776
I don't feel so good.

1698
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:17,737
You're all right.

1699
02:15:17,737 --> 02:15:19,030
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.

1700
02:15:19,030 --> 02:15:20,657
I don't know...

1701
02:15:22,450 --> 02:15:23,618
I don't want to go.

1702
02:15:23,618 --> 02:15:25,495
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.

1703
02:15:25,495 --> 02:15:28,290
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1704
02:15:32,711 --> 02:15:34,296
I'm sorry.

1705
02:15:48,977 --> 02:15:50,562
He did it.

1706
02:16:15,378 --> 02:16:18,548
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

1707
02:16:35,482 --> 02:16:37,067
Oh, God.

1708
02:27:33,431 --> 02:27:35,016
<i>Still no word
from Stark?</i>

1709
02:27:35,016 --> 02:27:36,351
<i>No, not yet.</i>

1710
02:27:36,351 --> 02:27:37,477
<i>We're watching every satellite</i>

1711
02:27:37,477 --> 02:27:39,646
<i>on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.</i>

1712
02:27:39,646 --> 02:27:41,731
What is it?

1713
02:27:41,731 --> 02:27:44,317
Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.

1714
02:27:44,317 --> 02:27:46,403
Same energy signature
as New York?

1715
02:27:46,403 --> 02:27:47,654
Ten times bigger.

1716
02:27:49,281 --> 02:27:50,448
Tell Klein
we'll meet him at...

1717
02:27:50,448 --> 02:27:51,533
Nick! Nick!

1718
02:28:05,171 --> 02:28:06,423
They okay?

1719
02:28:07,424 --> 02:28:09,301
There's no one here.

1720
02:28:18,685 --> 02:28:20,270
Call Control.

1721
02:28:21,062 --> 02:28:22,314
Code red.

1722
02:28:22,856 --> 02:28:24,024
Nick.

1723
02:28:25,567 --> 02:28:26,568
Hill.

1724
02:28:41,541 --> 02:28:42,667
Oh, no.

1725
02:28:44,377 --> 02:28:45,378
Mother...
