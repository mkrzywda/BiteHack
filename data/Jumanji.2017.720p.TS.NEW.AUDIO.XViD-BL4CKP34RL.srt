1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Play one of the best new FPS shooters,
search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK

2
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,930
- Hey, boy!
- What?

3
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,170
I found something. Come and see.

4
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,700
Jumanji.

5
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:20,199
A game on the board. Who is playing such games?

6
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:43,112
Makoto77

7
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:52,321
<b>  JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE </ b> </ font></b>

8
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:54,901
Okay, guard up! Uppercut!

9
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:04,503
You're dead. Attack, attack, counterattack and down with it!

10
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:07,532
<i>You got it?</i>

11
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,072
Yes.

12
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:11,732
YOU LOSE

13
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:18,132
<i>Freak house in 20 minutes.</i>

14
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:24,932
Benjamin Franklin; And it was this sense of national exclusivity

15
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:27,831
which fueled the spread of the wild fire of the Westward expansion.

16
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:30,871
Spencer, honey.

17
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,133
Mom,what we say about knock to the door.

18
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,103
I'm late at work, go to your father after school?

19
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:38,133
- Yes probably.
- Do not forget the equipment.

20
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,853
And you should know that world is a terifying  place.

21
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,773
I love you more than my life. See you on Sunday.

22
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:45,023
okay.

23
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,972
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Eat something before you leave.

24
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:55,832
I can not, I'm going to meet Spencer.

25
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:57,872
- Spencer Gilman?
- Yes, Spencer Gilman.

26
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:00,372
He meditated and helped me get good grades.

27
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:04,732
I'm glad to hear that. So Spencer Gilpen.

28
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:07,114
- Do you have good grades?
- Yes mother, that's why I ask for help.

29
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:12,233
- I do not want you out of the team.
- I will not get out of the team.

30
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,613
It'll be okay.

31
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,324
Nice.

32
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:40,874
Yes.

33
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:46,934
<i>Bethany Walker. I just woke up. Good morning.</i>

34
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:06,943
- Hello.
- Hello, Fridge.

35
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,553
Why do you wear a rain cloak?

36
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:10,565
- What do you want to say?
- It does not rain.

37
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:12,245
It might rain.

38
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:18,534
What the hell are you?

39
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:22,804
Let's finish this! I feel very uncomfortable.

40
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:25,274
Here you go.

41
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:27,934
- Have you checked everything?
- Yes, I checked.

42
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:32,274
I gave it a start and an end.

43
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:34,104
And something comprised.

44
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:37,134
I would have done it if I had time.

45
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:39,173
Yeah, that's not a big deal.

46
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:44,565
I thought it fun to help you do your homework, but...

47
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,115
I do not know what you're doing on the weekend, maybe...

48
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:50,975
This weekend, yes...

49
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,115
- Good, Fridge!
- Hi.

50
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:55,105
Do you want me to take you with the car?

51
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,705
- I'm going with her.
- It's better for me.

52
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:04,024
I have my own program. I'll see you later, "Fridge."

53
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:04,184
Sorry.

54
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:09,154
Hello, face.

55
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:14,974
I do not care. He's not the best friend of his childhood.

56
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:16,766
What you say?

57
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:22,805
Nothing, sir.

58
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:27,005
- This guy's really weird.
- The poor man.

59
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:30,375
It was terrible what happened to them.

60
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,575
I was referring to the kids.

61
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:34,095
What are you doing here?

62
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:37,005
I was talking to my friend earlier.

63
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:40,835
- You have to be more careful, do you hear?
- Yes, Mr. Rick.

64
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:45,934
- I understand.
- This world swallows babies like you.

65
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:05,175
It's been two hours after I posted and did not comment.

66
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,135
Because he does not like it. Did you see her?

67
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:10,975
<i>Yes, huge. I do not know what his problem is.</i>

68
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:14,135
Thanks. And I do not always post, just enough to be relevant.

69
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:19,135
<i>- But that's funny.
- Is this a strange person behind you?</i>

70
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,335
- Hi.
- Hi.

71
00:07:22,177 --> 00:07:25,007
Bethany, did you call during the test?

72
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:27,016
Yeah, but I finished my test.

73
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:31,206
Do you realize that others have not finished yet?

74
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,906
- And?
- Sorry.

75
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:38,936
Do you know there are other people in the world?

76
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:44,006
I got something done right now.

77
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,906
I'm not happy either.

78
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:50,165
I have a crisis, and Lucinda asserts me as a woman.

79
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:54,137
Maybe you should do it too.

80
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:56,137
- Shut the phone!
- Okay no problem.

81
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:59,087
- Bethany, close it now.
- Two more minutes and I'm done.

82
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:02,177
That means detention.

83
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:06,877
Okay, keep your hands up. Come on!

84
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:10,936
- Bethany, you're late.
- I am sorry!

85
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,906
I heard he was separated from the footballer.

86
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:17,976
Maybe that's your chance.

87
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:22,816
We'll practice catching and throwing. Take your partner and a ball.

88
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,976
Pry yourself!

89
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:30,568
Martha, you can not play alone.

90
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:33,877
Find a partner. Grãbeºte up!

91
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:36,837
I'm not ok.

92
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:38,087
Good.

93
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:44,607
You have to participate, just like everyone else.

94
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,077
- If not, why are you here?
- It's a compulsory hour.

95
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,937
- Martha ..
- It's useless.

96
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:52,327
The time of the sport would not go to Princeton,

97
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:56,106
And are not obsessed with throwing the ball and leaps, and touchdowns!

98
00:08:56,106 --> 00:09:00,108
Okay, it's wrong, but...

99
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,118
It is a beneficial physical activity.

100
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:04,808
And it benefits others.

101
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:07,908
And if you try, you may like it.

102
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:10,578
Is that what we are doing here? We are having fun?

103
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:14,578
Here we are at school, we need to learn important things.

104
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:17,027
- Good.
- We do not have much time in our lives.

105
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:20,577
And I do not want to waste it by being a teacher of physical education.

106
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:27,007
- It sounds crappy.
- Yes.

107
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:29,977
That means detention.

108
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:30,777
- Mommy.
- Smack.

109
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:37,089
Spencer Gilpen.

110
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:43,068
Take a seat, Spencer.

111
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,008
Mrs. Mathers.

112
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:56,298
And with that feeling of national exceptions,

113
00:09:56,298 --> 00:10:00,947
which fueled the spread of the wild fire of the Westward expansion.

114
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:04,017
Is he familiar, Mr. Gilpen?

115
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:06,099
Not.

116
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:10,029
It was the last line of Anthony's thesis on Westward expansion.

117
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:13,039
And coincidence, that's your last line

118
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,969
to the thesis on Westward's expansion last year.

119
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,009
Interesting.

120
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:23,168
- Yes?
- That's what I think.

121
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,208
What were the chances?

122
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,178
Very small.

123
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:29,948
Yes, you used the same metaphor.

124
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:33,978
The spread of wild fire in the Boston Tea Party thesis,

125
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:39,120
Battle at Gettysburg and Suffocation Movement.

126
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,199
- It's so hot in this room.
- Anthony.

127
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:48,159
I know you have to pass the class, but not that way.

128
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,139
- I will not tolerate cheating.
- Cheating?

129
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,139
- I did not cheat.
- It's my fault.

130
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,209
I did it to him.

131
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:04,089
Did you make him ask you to write his thesis?

132
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:05,088
Yes.

133
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:10,980
- I am sorry.
- Not.

134
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,130
I'll be kicked out of the team.

135
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,030
Yes, but you could expel me.

136
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,200
Not only do you live dangerously.

137
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,170
- Are I living dangerously?
- Yes.

138
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,109
It's the most dangerous thing I've ever done in my life.

139
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,209
And now look at me. Accept the consequences.

140
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:36,009
What a fun group.

141
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,219
Welcome to detention.

142
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:42,089
- Yes, Spencer?
- I just want to apologize.

143
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:44,251
- Thank you.
- Bentley director, I just called.

144
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:47,191
Bethany, you're here for a reason.

145
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:50,130
That's what you need to think about.

146
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,160
Who are you at this moment?

147
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,110
And who you want to be.

148
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,950
You have only one life, decide how you live.

149
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,989
Fortunately, there is no better place than detention to reflect.

150
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:13,219
Let's go.

151
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:28,971
We will turn this place into a new computer center.

152
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:30,981
But before doing so, it must be cleaned.

153
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,240
All of these old magazines will be recycled.

154
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,210
But they must be prepared before they are sent.

155
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,120
He must remove all the staples.

156
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,110
If you do not finish today, tomorrow is one day.

157
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,100
- But tomorrow is Saturday.
- Because I do not want to..

158
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,250
Yes, I do not think it will work.

159
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,190
It's correct.

160
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,162
I suggest you get started.

161
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:54,191
Choose your weapons.

162
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:03,161
Why is there a bowling ball here?

163
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:07,081
Really? No signal? Can it be more than that?

164
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:11,011
Are you helping us or are you too beautiful?

165
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:13,951
I'm too beautiful.

166
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,180
I followed the discussion with the Web Coach.

167
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,062
Not in a weird way.

168
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:25,962
We were in the same class with you.

169
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:31,942
I think you said intelligent things about the sports hour.

170
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:34,942
And about other topics.

171
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:35,782
Thanks.

172
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,071
Yes.

173
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,141
What is this?

174
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:51,081
- I do not know.
- Is that kind of old Nintendo?

175
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,181
I do not believe.

176
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:56,133
I do not recognize him.

177
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:15,182
A game for those who are looking to find

178
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:18,112
a way to leave the world.

179
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:20,052
<i>Welcome to JUMANJI</i>

180
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,081
Jumanji.

181
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:24,051
Staples.

182
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:27,923
- Jumanji, what does that mean?
- I do not know, I did not hear about him.

183
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:30,953
SELECT CHARACTER

184
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:36,133
- Which one to choose?
- I do not know, I do not think it matters.

185
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:41,073
Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough. Pilot and bastard.

186
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:44,062
- That does not work.
- Okay, try another one.

187
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:48,042
Franklin "Mouse" Finbar.

188
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,012
Sounds funny.

189
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:50,862
He's a zoologist.

190
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:58,022
- Choose yourself too.
- Good.

191
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:04,034
Doctor Smolder Bravestone.

192
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:09,133
- Bethany, do you play?
- Good.

193
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:15,103
I'll choose Shelly Oberon.

194
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:17,203
Sexy genius.

195
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:22,983
- Well, staples, it's your turn.
- No, thank you.

196
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:26,073
Just a minute. It will be fun.

197
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:29,052
He does not like having fun.

198
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,024
Good.

199
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,024
May.

200
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:40,064
It's the most unconvincing thing I've ever done.

201
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,004
I doubt very much.

202
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:50,213
<i>Welcome to Jumanji.</i>

203
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:03,023
What happens?

204
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:08,195
I think it's a short circuit.

205
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:16,034
Disconnect the cable!

206
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:26,944
- What happens? What about your hands?
- What's wrong with you?

207
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,044
I do not know.

208
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:35,353
Dear good!

209
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:45,985
What the hell? Not!

210
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:31,045
Friends! It does not sound like my voice.

211
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:41,024
Where is my hair?

212
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,036
What the hell?

213
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,286
Lord!

214
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:19,187
Very bad.

215
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,926
- Who are you?
- Yeah, who are you?

216
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,966
Who is she?

217
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,026
Who are you?

218
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,066
Good. What the hell...

219
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:34,166
- God!
- Get out of me!

220
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,146
What's my voice?

221
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:38,976
- Get out of me.
- Where am I?

222
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:39,976
Get!

223
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:50,217
What happened...

224
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:54,217
with the rest of me? What do I have in the crap?

225
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,067
- What is this?
- God.

226
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:58,877
Fridge?

227
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,227
Yes, who are you?

228
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,976
I'm Spencer.

229
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:11,936
What the? You're fuckin '! What happens?

230
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:16,956
- I think we're in the game.
- Sorry?

231
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,196
- What are you talking about?
- Somehow...

232
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:22,958
I do not know how... We were absorbed into the game.

233
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,058
And we become the avatar we choose.

234
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:32,027
It's me, Spencer. But I look and talk to Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

235
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:39,387
You want to tell me you're Spencer?

236
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,977
Yes Yes. That's right. Fridge, I'm Spencer.

237
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:47,177
You are Finbar Mouse. Write on your vest.

238
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:47,897
And...

239
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:53,086
- Martha? You are Ruby Roundhouse.
- Yes.

240
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:57,028
Bethany, you're Professor Shelly Oberon.

241
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:58,998
Only Shelly's Sheldon abridged.

242
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,968
- What are you talking about?
- God, he's right.

243
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:07,998
- And are you Spencer? You?
- Yes. Believe me, my friends.

244
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,237
I'm Spencer.

245
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:13,037
Yeah, it's Spencer.

246
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,837
That means I...

247
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,247
Wait.

248
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,247
Not!

249
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:29,989
I'm a middle-aged fat man.

250
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:35,198
I have a tattoo. My mom told me that it kills me if I do.

251
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:38,028
I have one too.

252
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,068
Sometimes.

253
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:47,008
Stay here, where's my cell phone?

254
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:52,008
Why do I wear this jungle suit?

255
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:55,217
It's kinda little and a little tight.

256
00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:58,087
Looks like a dwarf of the garden. Where's my cell phone?

257
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,059
- Who cares?
- We're in someone else's body.

258
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,999
It's not something your cell phone is.

259
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:07,019
Really? Is not the right time to call someone?

260
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,199
Or to give an SMS? Or change your status to "Prins in Game"?

261
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:13,969
I do not have Claritin to me either.

262
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:15,229
And I'm almost allergic to everything.

263
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:19,008
Do you have any allergies, Spencer?

264
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:22,018
I miss a part of my body.

265
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:24,208
It can not be possible.

266
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,148
Maybe we're all in a coma.

267
00:21:27,148 --> 00:21:30,088
Together? Are we all in coma together?

268
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:34,190
It's the best explanation.

269
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,279
Lord!

270
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:51,039
Lord. Better run and save him.

271
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,069
I will not go in there. Come in.

272
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,009
I do not go anywhere, I have a backpack.

273
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:58,079
Everyone knows they do not get into the water with a backpack.

274
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,220
- What the?
- Bethany.

275
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,190
Are you okay?

276
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,960
It's very intense.

277
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,940
I can not leave this place.

278
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,360
- What happened to you?
- I just hated a rhino.

279
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,239
Then I fell from 1000 meters from the sky.

280
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:25,939
- Yeah, that's what it looks like.
- It was a hippopotamus.

281
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:31,039
They are short-distance rapists and have a force of 8100 newtons.

282
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,119
How do I know that?

283
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,019
- You're a zoologist.
- What the?

284
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,011
- I'm fat, right?
- I'm afraid yes.

285
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:42,021
Why do you agree with that? I mean, it fell...

286
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:46,020
- From the sky.
- Friends?

287
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:49,570
Bethany, get up!

288
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,110
Come on, come on, come on.

289
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:09,249
Doctor Bravestone. Welcome to Jumanji.

290
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:13,151
Do not sit there, climb up.

291
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:16,161
Come on, come on!

292
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,970
Doctor Bravestone.

293
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,170
Famous archaeologist and international explorer.

294
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,170
Known on 7 continents for heroic deeds.

295
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,120
- Belt?
- I can not tell you what I'm honored...

296
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,980
to meet you in the end.

297
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,222
I'm not ashamed to say that you are even more beautiful in reality.

298
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,092
- Thank you.
- Who are you?

299
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:50,191
Nigel Vilengsly, your servant, Ruby Roundhouse, the killer of men.

300
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:52,101
Welcome to Jumanji.

301
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:55,191
We're just waiting for your arrival.

302
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:58,041
Jumanji is in great danger.

303
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,201
We hold four of you to lift the curse.

304
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,041
- Curse?
- What a curse?

305
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,101
Scuzaþi me. Did you see my cellphone somehow?

306
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:09,141
Professor Sheldon Oberon. Welcome to Jumanji.

307
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:11,120
Nigel Vilengsly is your servant.

308
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,020
We're just waiting for your arrival.

309
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,022
- Those with him?
- I think it's a NPC.

310
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:20,032
- What the? Tell me about it.
- A naughty character.

311
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:21,962
It's part of the game. So whatever we ask him...

312
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,092
only a few responses are scheduled.

313
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:26,122
Okay, I'm clear.

314
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:30,042
Franklin Mouse Finbar. Welcome to Jumanji.

315
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,202
Moose, not Mouse.

316
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:34,141
No, sir. I'm pretty sure it's Mouse.

317
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:37,061
- Mouse?
- A nickname for your stature.

318
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:39,981
And adorable behavior. I knew you'd come.

319
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:43,951
Doctor Bravestone does not go anywhere without his dear assistants.

320
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,081
Assistants?

321
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:49,953
Since Dr. Bravestone has saved you from the Peruvian jungle

322
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:51,203
You have never abandoned him.

323
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:54,092
- That's right.
- Let's go back to the curse.

324
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,932
I wrote everything in the letter sent, Doctor Bravestone.

325
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:58,662
Maybe you should read it out loud.

326
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:00,002
I do not have a letter...

327
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:08,862
OK.

328
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:15,112
Doctor Bravestone, I am writing to you about the desperate situation in Jumanji.

329
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:18,021
We need your help right away.

330
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,081
Friends, what's going on?

331
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:23,153
- What my rifle is going on?
- I think it's a trailer.

332
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:27,023
Many games have trailers to support the background story.

333
00:25:27,023 --> 00:25:32,003
My name is Nigel Vilengsly. Travel guide in Jumanji.

334
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:33,933
I was hired by your former partner,

335
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:39,002
now enemy, Professor Van Pelt. to conduct an expedition.

336
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:46,172
Professor Van Pelt searched for the altar of the jaguar.

337
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:50,012
The place where the gemstone of Jumanji lies.

338
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:54,024
You know how obsessive that gem is.

339
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:58,124
And after years of research, he discovered his location.

340
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:02,223
Yes, I finally found it.

341
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:06,103
Van Pelt told me he wanted to find her to write about her.

342
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:08,973
In his writings.

343
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:12,233
- It's real.
- What I did not know...

344
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:17,043
It's that he wanted to take the gem for him.

345
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:27,954
I found her!

346
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,394
I found her!

347
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:37,024
The legend says the Jaguar watches over Jumanji.

348
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:42,993
And anyone who tries to blind him will be consumed by a dark force.

349
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:48,033
Van Pelt became the leader of all creatures in Jumanji.

350
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:51,013
Possessing them, controlling them.

351
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:56,143
And a terrible curse has occupied this land.

352
00:26:57,153 --> 00:27:01,145
I asked him to put it back, but once in his hand

353
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:03,995
he will never let him go.

354
00:27:05,164 --> 00:27:08,134
I waited until they fell asleep that night.

355
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:11,134
And I went to attack.

356
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,155
Bring me the gem!

357
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:38,125
And kill anyone who tries to stop you.

358
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,085
Here is.

359
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:44,135
With your valuable help and associates

360
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:45,985
You must use your special abilities

361
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:48,194
to return the gem to the eye of the jaguar

362
00:27:48,194 --> 00:27:50,974
And to lift the curse.

363
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:53,174
I'm sure you want to start right away.

364
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:55,044
- Actually, I think...
- Good luck.

365
00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:58,204
The fate of Jumanji lies in your hands.

366
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,954
- What the?
- And do not forget...

367
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:03,114
The purpose is to recite it in verses.

368
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,246
Return the stone and lift the curse.

369
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:09,056
If you want to leave the game, you have to save Jumanji.

370
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,965
And call his name.

371
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:14,985
Good luck. The fate of Jumanji lies in your hands.

372
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,125
- And do not forget...
- Always say the same things.

373
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,965
Return the Gem and lift the curse.

374
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,065
If you want to leave the game you have to save Jumanji.

375
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:27,015
And call his name.

376
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:31,205
OK. You do it.

377
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:34,944
In the real world, people love you, you can meet with anyone you want.

378
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,114
So you say when you scare yourself?

379
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,146
Do you sit and judge me all the time?

380
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:42,996
I split myself from Noah, I turned into a man and I can not find my cell phone!

381
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:44,126
I'm allowed to be sad.

382
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:47,226
Doctor Bravestone, here's a Jumanji map.

383
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,136
Go to the Bazaar to find the missing piece.

384
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:52,126
- Bazaar?
- Missing part of what?

385
00:28:52,126 --> 00:28:55,035
- Goodbye.
- Can not we go to the statue?

386
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:58,095
And remember, if you want to leave the game...

387
00:28:58,095 --> 00:29:02,075
You have to save Jumanji and call his name.

388
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:12,087
You want to put it in your backpack?

389
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:13,287
Not.

390
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,996
Come on, you're the only one who has a backpack, Fridge.

391
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:20,156
And what if? We have a map, so we have to look ..

392
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:22,026
Bazaar, I think.

393
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,036
So we try to return the jewel to the jaguar statue.

394
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:27,066
And then we go home. No problem.

395
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:32,046
Why can not we go? Let's stop the game without doing it.

396
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:35,066
We have to finish the game.

397
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:40,985
I think we should save Jumanji.

398
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:52,157
Damn, what a man!

399
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,607
Don't cry...

400
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:01,036
Don't cry...

401
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:03,976
There are many diseases here.

402
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,136
It's hot.

403
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,236
That's what I'm good at. Play video games.

404
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:09,086
That's what I do.

405
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:14,146
There will be levels in such a game.

406
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,018
To finish the game, we must finish all levels.

407
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:19,608
They will become more and more difficult as we advance.

408
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:21,987
- We finish the level...
- Spencer, do you know where we're going?

409
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,157
- Somewhat.
- Somewhat?

410
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,227
It's good.

411
00:30:25,227 --> 00:30:27,067
We are in good hands.

412
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:30,067
I think the missing part.

413
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:33,007
That's what we're looking for, the missing part of the map.

414
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:36,067
The problem is that there's nothing here.

415
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:38,257
What does that mean?

416
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:41,007
It's a map, as he said.

417
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,206
It's a map of Jumanji.

418
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:46,046
- Cartography.
- What is this?

419
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:48,218
Studying the maps. It's a skill of Professor Oberon.

420
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:50,058
Yes. That's right.

421
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,028
So you can not see, but I can.

422
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:55,958
The chosen characters have special abilities.

423
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,968
There must be a way to access our abilities.

424
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,098
What you did?

425
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:09,007
Power, fearlessness, speed, boomerang, education.

426
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:12,107
Intensity of burning.

427
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:17,037
What are you doing?

428
00:31:17,037 --> 00:31:19,017
What happened?

429
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:21,009
You just burned.

430
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:22,989
Weaknesses: Nothing?

431
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:28,158
How did you make your list appear?

432
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:29,258
I pressed my left arm.

433
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:35,248
Yes, on your breasts. Come on, I'll show you.

434
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:37,038
Stay away from me.

435
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,998
At least try to see in front of us.

436
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:45,238
Strengths: Karate, T'ai Chi, Aikido, Dance Fight?

437
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:48,117
Dance fight?

438
00:31:48,117 --> 00:31:48,917
Weakness: Venin.

439
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:54,859
Really?

440
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:59,189
What does Paleontology mean?

441
00:31:59,189 --> 00:32:02,199
I think the fossil study.

442
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:04,129
It's the cargo.

443
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:09,099
Said karatesta sexy to the old fossil with no resistance.

444
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,258
I hate this game.

445
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:17,098
Weakness: the cake?

446
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:23,068
Yes, cake is my weakness. Together with speed and force.

447
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,228
Force is my weakness.

448
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:27,300
Hey, I can, quick question.

449
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,070
How is my weakness forced?

450
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,309
Somebody explain. And why do I need speed?

451
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:37,249
Why do I have to be fast when I'm being watched by a huge killer zebra?

452
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:38,629
And can I wear that shiny hat?

453
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:41,259
You're a valet.

454
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:45,249
- What this means?
- I think you're taking my gun

455
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:50,129
in your backpack and you give it to me when I need it.

456
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:54,258
Friends... Map...

457
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:56,298
- It's changed.
- I mean?

458
00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:58,138
- What's that?
- Well...

459
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:01,300
There is not much information, but now one minute did not write this.

460
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,400
Write "Powerful Shot".

461
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,249
I do not like this. I'm done.

462
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:18,159
- What else?
- Good.

463
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,129
And right here it says "Deep".

464
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:25,189
- Hippopotamus comes from deep. The one..
- Yes, who did the thing.

465
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:27,129
Let's continue.

466
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:28,619
If "Deep" is the first level,

467
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:32,111
then "Powerful Shot" must be the second level.

468
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,131
In what direction?

469
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:35,301
Good.

470
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:38,250
If that's what it is.

471
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,050
And that's here...

472
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,120
I think right here.

473
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,099
What is that game?

474
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:00,939
Fugiþi!

475
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,741
Wait!

476
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,220
Come on!

477
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,320
Why do I run so slowly?

478
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,232
Dear good!

479
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:46,111
- It's shit!
- Let's break up!

480
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,151
Lord!

481
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:28,091
- Come on!
- These guys have big weapons!

482
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:31,091
- What? Is that what it is about?
- See your backpack.

483
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:33,251
- Or what?
- In your backpack you have my gun!

484
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:37,371
I have your weapons.

485
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:43,103
I do not feel anything. What is this?

486
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:45,233
Yes, boomerang, one of my abilities.

487
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:46,303
What are you gonna do about it?

488
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:48,212
I do not know, I think I'll kill them.

489
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,272
- You want to kill them?
- Do you have a better idea?

490
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:52,282
Warning.

491
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:55,222
Take a look.

492
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:00,282
Good job.

493
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:05,322
We have to get out of here before we exterminate.

494
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:20,273
It's not possible.

495
00:36:26,223 --> 00:36:28,123
It worked!

496
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,113
Okay, we have to go.

497
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:33,282
I can not beat them at speed.

498
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,652
We have to go, climb behind me.

499
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,292
- I'd rather die.
- Come on, come on.

500
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:41,092
No, I'm gonna die.

501
00:36:41,092 --> 00:36:41,992
Get down, Spencer!

502
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:59,183
I think you're joking.

503
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:00,973
Not...

504
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:08,263
- We have to jump.
- Are you okay?

505
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:10,323
I'd like to do something else now than that.

506
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:14,323
- Piss!
- What the hell!

507
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:20,062
- We have to jump.
- We do not even know the depth of water.

508
00:37:20,062 --> 00:37:23,134
We have to jump.

509
00:37:23,134 --> 00:37:24,094
Jump up!

510
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:48,163
I think I've had a heart attack. I have difficulty in breathing.

511
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:50,293
It was the most embarrassing moment of my life.

512
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:52,193
Do not do that anymore.

513
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:54,235
I swallowed plenty of water.

514
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:02,144
They shot me.

515
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:04,114
It's not possible...

516
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:05,344
Martha?

517
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:12,194
What happened to her?

518
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:14,254
She's dead?

519
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:20,094
Just sit for a moment.

520
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:23,063
What the heck is happening?

521
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:25,293
- Get out of me.
- Are you okay?

522
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:28,275
- I guess.
- Get out of me.

523
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:31,215
- Are you okay?
- You want to kill me?

524
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:34,145
What am I, human landing zone?

525
00:38:36,215 --> 00:38:38,345
Just as I thought. Everyone has three lives.

526
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:42,245
These tattoos are small on the arms.

527
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:44,284
Mama da 'ce brand am!

528
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:46,314
Spencer.

529
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:48,124
What were you saying?

530
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:50,134
It's the number of our lives.

531
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:52,654
Bethany was eaten by hippopotamus and has only two lines.

532
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:54,264
Is right.

533
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:58,234
What happens when we exhaust the lines?

534
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:04,235
It usually means... that the game is over.

535
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:07,045
What do you want to say?

536
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,175
Are you saying we can even die here?

537
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:11,345
- I'm not sure.
- Are not you sure?

538
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:13,255
Are not you sure you are always playing?

539
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:20,285
I was not locked in here anymore. I'm not sure, but I think so, we can die.

540
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:25,225
That worries me most now.

541
00:39:29,304 --> 00:39:32,136
Let's find the missing part then.

542
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,386
Good.

543
00:39:37,076 --> 00:39:39,236
There seems to be another village behind this mountain.

544
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:42,076
Maybe it's the Bazaar.

545
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:48,145
- Let's go.
- One minute, I have to urinate first.

546
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:52,315
And I have, I've been on the whole day.

547
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:56,255
Can I come with you and show me how to do it?

548
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:59,325
I need your help.

549
00:39:59,325 --> 00:40:00,625
Yeah, sure, I'll help you.

550
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:10,076
So how do you do it?

551
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:14,176
Easily open the zipper, pull it off and pull it.

552
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:18,316
Do not forget to target, it's very important.

553
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:23,246
God, I have a penis attached to the body.

554
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:27,196
- Martha, look at my penis.
- No, thank you.

555
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:29,056
Is it the first time you saw him?

556
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:30,206
Yes, I did not want to forget.

557
00:40:30,206 --> 00:40:37,197
I just looked at how I got to her and I'm glad it's long like mine.

558
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:40,177
What are you doing? Are you looking?

559
00:40:40,177 --> 00:40:42,147
- Sorry.
- Do not look here.

560
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:45,077
It's important never to look.

561
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:49,277
Okay, good boy, we're gonna make it slowly not just you.

562
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:53,117
- Now what?
- Launch, and do not forget to target.

563
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,056
What's the point? What did you miss?

564
00:40:55,056 --> 00:40:57,056
Can not avoid the discussion?

565
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:00,176
It's much easier!

566
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:04,676
Commodity, right?

567
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:07,086
Yes, you can handle it more easily.

568
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:11,168
Mother I want to put on Instagram.

569
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,056
Bravestone?

570
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:40,196
He and the others.

571
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:43,068
They escaped?

572
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,198
I lost them in the jungle.

573
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,298
I should have known.

574
00:41:49,248 --> 00:41:52,108
What do you mean, sir?

575
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:57,178
I want every creature and every soldier to hunt them.

576
00:41:57,178 --> 00:42:00,317
Take what is mine.

577
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:05,317
Finds him.

578
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:10,237
Be careful with the ground.

579
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:14,137
The earth is slippery, I do not want to get your ankle stuck.

580
00:42:14,137 --> 00:42:17,139
- Shut up.
- Good.

581
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:20,069
- Are you borrowing my coat?
- Yes of course.

582
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:23,238
- What are you doing?
- I feel bikini harbor in school.

583
00:42:23,238 --> 00:42:26,178
I did it once and sent me to the director.

584
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:27,578
Of course.

585
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:31,178
Noah likes to see some skin, that's the key to our relationship.

586
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:39,288
I can not open my mouth around you, you do not know me, but you hate me.

587
00:42:39,288 --> 00:42:40,188
I do not hate you.

588
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:46,157
- Do not you hate me?
- Not.

589
00:42:46,157 --> 00:42:53,109
I thought you were like a popular girl, and they all treat you like a princess.

590
00:42:54,109 --> 00:43:00,139
Maybe that makes you think a little bit about you.

591
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:04,088
It's correct.

592
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:07,218
But do you think the reason you judge me...

593
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:12,128
Is it because you're afraid the world does not like you, and you decided not to like it first?

594
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:13,128
Not.

595
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:17,298
May be...

596
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:21,070
Well then.

597
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:25,130
I'm just saying you're a chick. Keep it as such.

598
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:27,339
Thanks.

599
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:28,299
I guess.

600
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:41,149
- Come to me, Spencer.
- Why are you so upset about me?

601
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:43,229
Do you really ask me?

602
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:50,228
You kicked me out of the team and you got me here.

603
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:55,270
Are we no longer friends that we are stuck in Jumanji? I do not believe this.

604
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:58,280
We're no longer friends that I'm not cool enough to go out with you.

605
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,340
So you pretend you do not know me anymore.

606
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,310
Until you needed themes you could not do it yourself.

607
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,340
No wonder you do not know anything about the Westward expansion.

608
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
See?

609
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,119
I'm not stupid, Spencer.

610
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,329
I asked you to make me a simple favor.

611
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:17,059
I told you to do my homework, do not get out of the squad and kick it.

612
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:21,089
And I can not do what I know better, and it's just your fault.

613
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:24,289
I should get married.

614
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,200
- I want to see you try.
- What you said?

615
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,600
Good.

616
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,280
- See what's going on here.
- Boys.

617
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,790
Do you think that if you have 1.97m,

618
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:47,250
122 pounds of muscle, I fear you?

619
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,260
That you think?

620
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,140
May be.

621
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:03,131
All the annoying child I met in the 7th.

622
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:05,201
You never change.

623
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:08,241
Do not let your new body make you arrogant.

624
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:15,290
Fool.

625
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,350
Not!

626
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,330
Spencer!

627
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,620
- You killed him!
- You're crazy!

628
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,100
Calm down, he'll be back.

629
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:52,111
- Do not do me anymore.
- Do not push me anymore.

630
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:56,151
- Or what, Spencer?
- Or I'll push you back.

631
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:10,062
Did you burst me?

632
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:12,212
Did you burst me?

633
00:46:12,212 --> 00:46:14,272
Fridge, no.

634
00:46:16,252 --> 00:46:18,112
I will beat you.

635
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,131
Enough!

636
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:26,091
We can not waste our lives.

637
00:46:26,091 --> 00:46:30,221
We like it or not, we need each other.

638
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,321
We need to do this together.

639
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:38,103
Can you repeat?

640
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:39,363
Do we have to do this together?

641
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:44,132
Do you control yourself? Or does it happen naturally?

642
00:46:44,132 --> 00:46:47,242
It happens naturally.

643
00:47:15,273 --> 00:47:17,073
What should we do here?

644
00:47:17,073 --> 00:47:18,403
We look for the missing part of the map.

645
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:20,173
And we ask her?

646
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:25,113
No, we look around, we investigate, but most importantly, friends...

647
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:27,212
Let's be discreet.

648
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:30,192
Fresh, fresh bread!

649
00:47:30,192 --> 00:47:34,162
Does anyone have money? I starve.

650
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:36,322
Take your fresh bread.

651
00:47:38,262 --> 00:47:43,104
Friends, I think the game is trying to tell us to eat.

652
00:47:43,104 --> 00:47:46,074
- We have to...
- Do not do that anymore.

653
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:48,343
God, what a good thing, I have not eaten bread since 9 years.

654
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:52,173
- Are you serious?
- How do you think I have this belly?

655
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,243
Give me too.

656
00:47:58,183 --> 00:48:00,213
Wait... what is that?

657
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:02,283
It's my favorite cake.

658
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:04,223
Cake?

659
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:06,323
But you said it was bread.

660
00:48:06,323 --> 00:48:08,293
I have not eaten much and I forgot my taste.

661
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:11,092
I do not even...

662
00:48:11,092 --> 00:48:13,062
- Something wrong with me?
- Not.

663
00:48:13,062 --> 00:48:14,292
- Shaking me?
- Not.

664
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:17,274
- I'm weird?
- Not.

665
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:20,244
- Are I still black?
- Yes.

666
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:21,464
OK friend.

667
00:48:23,274 --> 00:48:25,274
I'm fine, everything is fine.

668
00:48:25,274 --> 00:48:30,274
I just found out that I like the cake, so I could not resist it.

669
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,113
It's all right...

670
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,275
What the hell?

671
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:55,264
As I said, you have to be discreet.

672
00:48:55,264 --> 00:48:58,174
- You said it and eat.
- Fresh bread.

673
00:48:58,174 --> 00:48:59,134
Go away!

674
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:06,214
Dr. Bravestone, fine you are here, Jumanji needs you.

675
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:09,184
Thanks. We're glad to be here.

676
00:49:09,184 --> 00:49:11,054
Ask him about the missing part.

677
00:49:11,054 --> 00:49:13,114
Okay, I'm Bethany.

678
00:49:13,114 --> 00:49:20,063
I mean, Professor Sherly, and I have a map with a missing piece.

679
00:49:21,305 --> 00:49:25,105
Dr. Bravestone, fine you are here, Jumanji needs you.

680
00:49:25,105 --> 00:49:26,305
Really?

681
00:49:26,305 --> 00:49:30,175
We have to find the missing part.

682
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:06,145
What you need is in the basket.

683
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:09,115
A wrong move and you die.

684
00:50:09,115 --> 00:50:13,115
Trust each other and do not blink.

685
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:17,125
The missing part is not what you think it is.

686
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,285
Dear good.

687
00:50:18,285 --> 00:50:22,284
- Good luck my hero, Jumanji...
- She needs you.

688
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:25,194
We know, you said that.

689
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:37,076
So, do you think there's a snake there, or something like that?

690
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:40,106
Yeah, it's more like your kind.

691
00:50:40,106 --> 00:50:41,246
Why would that be my kind?

692
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:46,275
Because you're her hero. Get to work.

693
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:02,337
I do not want to do that!

694
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:04,276
Just do it!

695
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:27,225
Mamba black!

696
00:51:28,195 --> 00:51:29,225
It was Mamba black.

697
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:31,927
A quarter of a milligram of venom is enough to kill an adult.

698
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:33,127
It numbs your mouth,

699
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:37,297
followed by fever and you lose control of your muscles.

700
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:39,177
How can I know all this?

701
00:51:39,177 --> 00:51:41,337
- What should we do?
- Have you seen anything else there?

702
00:51:41,337 --> 00:51:42,547
I did not see that I had no time.

703
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:46,237
Come on, trust each other, and never blink.

704
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:49,186
I think it's a holbat contest.

705
00:51:49,186 --> 00:51:50,256
- What the?
- What are you talking about?

706
00:51:50,256 --> 00:51:53,346
- Think about it! What does it mean not to blink?
- Friends, I think he's right.

707
00:51:53,346 --> 00:51:56,296
If we see a rattle snake, we do not move too much.

708
00:51:56,296 --> 00:52:00,126
I think someone should look directly at the snake and not blink.

709
00:52:00,126 --> 00:52:03,226
And then Spencer stretches and takes whatever's in there.

710
00:52:03,226 --> 00:52:05,228
- Why me?
- Because it's your mission.

711
00:52:05,228 --> 00:52:10,067
Okay, then who will look at it and will not blink?

712
00:52:12,207 --> 00:52:14,177
I'm good at doing that.

713
00:52:14,177 --> 00:52:16,337
Then this is your moment.

714
00:52:29,977 --> 00:52:31,776
Tell me when.

715
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,286
Now.

716
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,348
What should we do?

717
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:53,287
- We have to deactivate it.
- What the?

718
00:52:54,317 --> 00:52:58,047
We have to pull his mouth out of the blind spot.

719
00:52:58,047 --> 00:53:02,117
We need to be very careful with the venomous gland.

720
00:53:02,117 --> 00:53:05,187
We need to break his teeth.

721
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:08,137
Everyone.

722
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:15,208
It was not until then a holbat contest.

723
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:19,078
Trust each other and never blink.

724
00:53:19,078 --> 00:53:23,068
You trusted me and deactivated the serpent.

725
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:24,348
I did, I did.

726
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:27,218
Yeah, you did.

727
00:53:27,218 --> 00:53:32,178
- Thank you.
- Yes of course.

728
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:45,329
Friends, that does not look like a piece of paper.

729
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:48,309
The missing part is an elephant?

730
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:52,149
There's something written on the wrapping paper.

731
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:56,109
When you see me, start climbing.

732
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:57,309
Start climbing?

733
00:53:57,309 --> 00:54:00,288
When do we see an elephant?

734
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:04,158
I turned off the snake.

735
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:11,188
You have to find elephants for the next level in the game.

736
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,290
Hey!

737
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,130
Fugiþi!

738
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,109
Warning!

739
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:31,209
Jump up!

740
00:54:42,128 --> 00:54:46,158
I have to warn you, I think I have a strong punch.

741
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,410
Very.

742
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,100
Very, very, very...

743
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,200
Uppercut.

744
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,310
Esche. We're hitting our heads.

745
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,870
Caput!

746
00:55:06,149 --> 00:55:08,119
Esche. Lock.

747
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:13,289
Escape, blow.

748
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:16,129
Break into the wall!

749
00:55:16,129 --> 00:55:17,569
Mommy crazy!

750
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,300
Let's do it.

751
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,170
What to do?

752
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,310
Put it in my backpack.

753
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,280
Esche. We head off.

754
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,150
Throw the ceiling!

755
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:07,081
Hi, Doctor.

756
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:09,280
It's been a long time.

757
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:16,250
I'm sure you have something that belongs to me.

758
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,160
We just want to go home.

759
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,290
Come on, follow me fast.

760
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,272
Put your hand on them!

761
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,211
Come on!

762
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:43,171
Down here, fast.

763
00:57:02,072 --> 00:57:04,232
Follow me and do exactly what I'm telling you.

764
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:06,242
Let's go.

765
00:57:07,312 --> 00:57:11,112
God, I'm glad you came.

766
00:57:11,112 --> 00:57:12,322
- Yes?
- I'm very pleased.

767
00:57:12,322 --> 00:57:16,211
I saw you in the Bazaar and I thought it was not possible.

768
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:20,151
But I think so. Go back to the wall!

769
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:22,891
Dear good!

770
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:27,281
Let's go further.

771
00:57:28,201 --> 00:57:30,251
- Watch where you are.
- Who are you?

772
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:34,293
- Yeah, like who you got us?
- That's right. Sorry. My mistake.

773
00:57:34,293 --> 00:57:36,173
Let me explain.

774
00:57:36,173 --> 00:57:38,162
Wait a minute. Are you the pilot?

775
00:57:38,162 --> 00:57:44,172
- Yes I am.
- And you were absorbed in the game?

776
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:47,342
- A step back and sit back.
- Why?

777
00:57:54,192 --> 00:57:56,282
Very scary.

778
00:57:56,282 --> 00:57:59,231
Mommy how bad.

779
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:03,151
Wait.

780
00:58:08,173 --> 00:58:11,233
All right, let's take this plank.

781
00:58:15,383 --> 00:58:16,583
Follow me.

782
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:21,272
Carefully. It's a terrible way to die.

783
00:58:24,222 --> 00:58:24,972
So.

784
00:58:32,362 --> 00:58:34,332
Come on.

785
00:58:36,102 --> 00:58:37,164
I can, I can.

786
00:58:37,164 --> 00:58:40,304
I deactivated the snake, give me some respect.

787
00:58:45,143 --> 00:58:47,113
Good.

788
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:57,173
Hi.

789
00:58:57,173 --> 00:58:57,923
Hi.

790
00:59:05,092 --> 00:59:05,812
Let's.

791
00:59:19,144 --> 00:59:22,114
By the way, I'm Alex.

792
00:59:22,114 --> 00:59:24,104
Spencer Gilpen.

793
00:59:24,104 --> 00:59:27,213
Martha, Fridge and Bethany.

794
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:28,313
Bethany?

795
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:31,283
- Are you a girl?
- Woman.

796
00:59:31,283 --> 00:59:34,293
In real life you probably do not touch her.

797
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:45,065
They have escaped, they seem to have been helped.

798
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:46,295
Seaplane.

799
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:49,334
They probably got rid of the channels.

800
00:59:50,144 --> 00:59:52,204
I'm sorry boss.

801
00:59:52,204 --> 00:59:55,144
It will not happen again.

802
00:59:57,184 --> 00:59:58,024
I know.

803
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:15,225
What do you prepare?

804
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:17,195
Margarita, is one of my abilities.

805
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:18,295
That and piloting.

806
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:22,175
Though I was shot down by orangutans and fighters.

807
01:00:22,175 --> 01:00:25,265
So maybe I'm not that good.

808
01:00:25,265 --> 01:00:26,105
Cheers.

809
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:32,084
- Thank you.
- Sure.

810
01:00:32,084 --> 01:00:34,344
- I've never been drinking any more.
- Me neither.

811
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:38,254
- You know what? Damn it!
- Cheers!

812
01:00:44,094 --> 01:00:47,154
- I'm done with that.
- It's good.

813
01:00:47,154 --> 01:00:49,356
Can a repetir be?

814
01:00:49,356 --> 01:00:51,136
Alex, what about these candles?

815
01:00:51,136 --> 01:00:54,075
Lãmâiþã. One of my weaknesses is the monsters.

816
01:00:54,075 --> 01:00:59,275
Which is pretty bad when you live alone in the middle of the forest.

817
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:02,145
Opa, he's alone.

818
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:03,275
Who's this?

819
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:05,345
Who's Alan Parrish?

820
01:01:05,345 --> 01:01:08,145
It's the one who built this place.

821
01:01:08,145 --> 01:01:10,225
Are you saying there have been others stuck here?

822
01:01:10,225 --> 01:01:12,115
Yeah, I mean, it's Alan Parrish's house.

823
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:13,185
I just live in it.

824
01:01:13,185 --> 01:01:18,124
Alex, how long have you been in the game?

825
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:20,606
It's hard to say. Time is weird here.

826
01:01:20,606 --> 01:01:23,156
But a few months at least.

827
01:01:23,156 --> 01:01:24,196
- Months?
- What the?

828
01:01:24,196 --> 01:01:29,196
- Yeah, we did not cross the place of transport.
- Is that what it is?

829
01:01:29,196 --> 01:01:31,236
The next level.

830
01:01:31,236 --> 01:01:34,176
The first time I could not take off with the balloon.

831
01:01:34,176 --> 01:01:37,305
Then with the whole plane.

832
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:41,315
And when we came to the last life...

833
01:01:41,315 --> 01:01:43,315
I realized I was done.

834
01:01:43,315 --> 01:01:46,325
And I will not get out of here alone.

835
01:01:46,325 --> 01:01:49,225
I could not handle it myself.

836
01:01:49,225 --> 01:01:51,285
You can not kill a black Mamba with a margarita.

837
01:01:51,285 --> 01:01:53,197
You can.

838
01:01:53,197 --> 01:01:56,197
You need a zoologist for that.

839
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:59,336
Alex, we can help each other.

840
01:01:59,336 --> 01:02:04,136
You've been here for a long time, you know the game and we have a lot of power with us.

841
01:02:04,136 --> 01:02:08,136
Yeah, we're working fine together.

842
01:02:08,136 --> 01:02:13,316
I do not know, if I lose again, I'm done.

843
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:18,256
It really scares me when I'm thinking of going back to the plane.

844
01:02:19,296 --> 01:02:21,225
I do not want to die in Jumanji.

845
01:02:21,225 --> 01:02:23,125
We just have to stay together.

846
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:26,187
We do that and we can win, I know that.

847
01:02:28,107 --> 01:02:29,157
Dear good!

848
01:02:29,157 --> 01:02:30,597
You are the missing part.

849
01:02:30,597 --> 01:02:32,327
You were the one we were supposed to find.

850
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:37,247
The clue was to go to the Bazaar to find the missing part?

851
01:02:37,247 --> 01:02:40,077
He was not an elephant.

852
01:02:41,187 --> 01:02:44,306
- It was me.
- Yes.

853
01:02:46,216 --> 01:02:48,186
Friends...

854
01:02:48,186 --> 01:02:51,156
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

855
01:02:52,326 --> 01:02:55,256
Spencer, are you in your margarita?

856
01:02:55,256 --> 01:02:59,128
That's a good margarita.

857
01:03:06,307 --> 01:03:07,337
Here is.

858
01:03:07,337 --> 01:03:09,207
Place of transport.

859
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:11,237
There are many vehicles in there.

860
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:16,187
We have to take one, cross the canyon and go to the statue of the jaguar.

861
01:03:16,187 --> 01:03:21,117
Okay, I see the place of transport, I see the canyon, but I still do not see the statue.

862
01:03:21,117 --> 01:03:23,157
And that's weird, because it's the most important thing

863
01:03:23,157 --> 01:03:25,087
Work in Jumanji and it's immense.

864
01:03:25,087 --> 01:03:26,316
That's what she says.

865
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,156
Are you drunk, Fridge?

866
01:03:30,156 --> 01:03:33,168
- No, I'm not drunk.
- He's drunk.

867
01:03:33,168 --> 01:03:35,138
I only drank 3 glasses of margarita.

868
01:03:35,138 --> 01:03:36,718
You are half the real size.

869
01:03:36,718 --> 01:03:37,828
Indifferent...

870
01:03:37,828 --> 01:03:40,368
Okay, Alex, what are we doing here? How are we going through the guards?

871
01:03:40,368 --> 01:03:42,138
Last time I waited for them to leave.

872
01:03:42,138 --> 01:03:45,078
- How long did it take?
- Three weeks.

873
01:03:45,078 --> 01:03:46,278
We're gonna die.

874
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:50,077
- All right, Plan B.
- There might be another door there.

875
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:53,107
But we must distract the guards first.

876
01:03:53,107 --> 01:03:54,177
I know.

877
01:03:54,177 --> 01:03:56,247
I'm good at distracting men.

878
01:03:56,247 --> 01:03:59,057
He plays video games and I distract men.

879
01:03:59,057 --> 01:04:01,157
Bethany, I'm sorry to let you know,

880
01:04:01,157 --> 01:04:05,119
but you do not have the utensils for it now.

881
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,839
Not I.

882
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:09,358
What the?

883
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:11,308
- You have to go down and seduce yourself.
- Not.

884
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:14,138
- And distract them.
- Not!

885
01:04:14,138 --> 01:04:18,078
I can not go and seduce soldiers I do not know.

886
01:04:18,078 --> 01:04:20,138
I know, but now we have no better idea.

887
01:04:20,138 --> 01:04:23,348
You do not understand, I can not do it.

888
01:04:25,088 --> 01:04:28,288
I'm not good at talking to men.

889
01:04:28,288 --> 01:04:31,287
I hope that I teach you.

890
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:38,229
No sorry. We need another plan, I will not do that.

891
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:42,109
Just distract them enough to get in.

892
01:04:42,109 --> 01:04:48,199
I can not Spencer, I'm not a dead woman.

893
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:52,109
What are you talking about? You're all right.

894
01:04:54,218 --> 01:04:57,088
You can do anything.

895
01:05:02,388 --> 01:05:07,228
Pretty, Spencer, do not you want to put a romantic candle in your house?

896
01:05:07,228 --> 01:05:10,170
Or do you want to get the hell out of here?

897
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:13,300
Okay, show me how.

898
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,119
Hours begin immediately. Come on, girl.

899
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,919
Watch and learn.

900
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,589
What would you like to say romantically with candles?

901
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:23,789
What are you talking about?

902
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:26,589
You said that Martha and me, drinking candles, what did you mean?

903
01:05:27,449 --> 01:05:29,189
The girl was watching you, Spencer.

904
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:31,089
What the?

905
01:05:39,738 --> 01:05:43,440
Well, as far as flirting is concerned, the key is to make them see you,

906
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,370
without telling them that you know they saw you.

907
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:50,390
And when I start talking to you, you can do three things.

908
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,450
You are doing the bad, interested, or bad.

909
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,320
Depends what men you are in front of.

910
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,399
It's like my nightmare dream.

911
01:05:58,399 --> 01:05:59,559
I will not take it personally.

912
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:04,399
Now the hair is everything. Touch it, move it.

913
01:06:04,399 --> 01:06:08,399
Play with him, move him a long way. Hypnotize him with him.

914
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:10,379
It turns that way.

915
01:06:10,379 --> 01:06:12,349
Now look your eyes down.

916
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:16,031
Leave your head down and have big eyes.

917
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:17,381
- It's shining now.
- Shining?

918
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:21,320
Like animated characters.

919
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:29,130
You need practice.

920
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,370
Do you really think I like it?

921
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,620
Why are we talking about this?

922
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:41,600
- If she tries to kiss me?
- You kiss it too.

923
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:47,311
If she tries to kiss me without warning me?

924
01:06:47,311 --> 01:06:49,441
What are you talking about? Have not you kissed anyone yet?

925
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:51,321
Not... Are you gonna tell this to everyone?

926
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:53,571
Boys, I found the side door.

927
01:06:53,571 --> 01:06:55,421
- Guess what I found out.
- No, do not tell them!

928
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:57,091
Okay, let's start with the way you walk.

929
01:06:57,091 --> 01:07:02,211
Slowly, like an elegant gazelle.

930
01:07:02,211 --> 01:07:05,250
Or a high-pitched horse. One foot in front of the other.

931
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,340
Come on, bum, bum, do not.

932
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:13,590
And everything you can attract attention, something like that.

933
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:16,940
It takes a very long time to do this.

934
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,720
Okay, that's better.

935
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,312
Now she smiles. You look terrified.

936
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:23,322
You are so funny...

937
01:07:23,322 --> 01:07:26,421
God, how funny you are.

938
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:29,401
- I think I already understand.
- That's true.

939
01:07:29,401 --> 01:07:31,321
Now keep your lips light, that way.

940
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:32,661
No, not disgusting, relax.

941
01:07:32,661 --> 01:07:36,451
Now he touches the tip of his mouth with his tongue.

942
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:37,451
- So?
- That's right.

943
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:42,121
So.

944
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:44,091
So?

945
01:07:45,381 --> 01:07:48,270
I think you're ready.

946
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,310
- Good.
- Good.

947
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:52,582
You as seduced as your life is at stake. Because that's right.

948
01:07:52,582 --> 01:07:56,422
Okay, that's the door, we need something to pull the fence.

949
01:07:56,422 --> 01:07:59,702
Fridge, have something in your backpack for something?

950
01:07:59,702 --> 01:08:01,392
Yes of course.

951
01:08:01,392 --> 01:08:04,432
I have some...

952
01:08:04,432 --> 01:08:06,192
Iron cutters.

953
01:08:06,192 --> 01:08:08,112
Is that a good tool in the given situation?

954
01:08:08,112 --> 01:08:10,331
Perfect, in fact.

955
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:12,601
This is called the power of the backpack.

956
01:08:13,401 --> 01:08:16,881
Hey, guys, I think this will work.

957
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:18,211
And I believe that.

958
01:08:18,211 --> 01:08:21,371
It's really great and they do not like to meet new people.

959
01:08:21,371 --> 01:08:22,741
Great?

960
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:26,583
Not like Cindy Crawford, but for Jumanji, it's a bomb.

961
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:29,083
- Bomb?
- Cindy Crawford?

962
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,453
- You think so?
- I say so.

963
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:33,452
I'd like to shoot it.

964
01:08:38,332 --> 01:08:39,592
Alex.

965
01:08:40,402 --> 01:08:42,592
What year do you think it is?

966
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:45,432
- What do you want to say?
- It's not possible.

967
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:46,632
It's 1996.

968
01:08:50,982 --> 01:08:53,341
You're Alex Rigg, are not you?

969
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:55,271
Yes, that's right.

970
01:08:55,271 --> 01:08:56,441
What do you want to say? The weird house?

971
01:08:56,441 --> 01:09:01,383
What are you talking about? How do you know me?

972
01:09:01,383 --> 01:09:06,353
- Alex, I do not know how to say this...
- You are in this game for 20 years.

973
01:09:06,353 --> 01:09:08,593
I would not have said that.

974
01:09:08,593 --> 01:09:10,483
What the?

975
01:09:10,483 --> 01:09:12,753
No, you joke?

976
01:09:12,753 --> 01:09:17,362
No, Alex Rigg, everyone knows about you.

977
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:19,562
You are the missing child.

978
01:09:19,562 --> 01:09:22,372
20 years ago.

979
01:09:22,372 --> 01:09:24,362
20 years?

980
01:09:24,362 --> 01:09:25,442
20 years.

981
01:09:27,342 --> 01:09:31,654
I do not even know how to say that, but Cindy Crawford's 50 years ago.

982
01:09:31,654 --> 01:09:35,324
- But she's still sexy.
- Yes.

983
01:09:35,324 --> 01:09:36,044
Yes...

984
01:09:41,593 --> 01:09:42,793
Here I am!

985
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:51,633
Hey.

986
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:56,883
We'll take you home.

987
01:09:56,883 --> 01:09:57,883
Yes.

988
01:10:19,404 --> 01:10:21,423
What the fuck did she have on the bottom?

989
01:10:21,423 --> 01:10:23,463
Bethany, what did you tell him to do?

990
01:10:23,463 --> 01:10:28,403
- Did some ankle sprain?
- He has not flirted so far.

991
01:10:32,343 --> 01:10:34,603
Hello little girl.

992
01:10:34,603 --> 01:10:38,375
What are you doing here alone?

993
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,715
Hello boy.

994
01:10:40,715 --> 01:10:43,334
Looks like I'm lost.

995
01:10:43,334 --> 01:10:45,454
Can you help me?

996
01:10:47,594 --> 01:10:50,424
Hello little girl.

997
01:10:50,424 --> 01:10:53,874
What are you doing here alone?

998
01:10:56,374 --> 01:10:58,504
You are very interesting and funny.

999
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,924
What's he doing?

1000
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:01,564
Did insects get in the hair?

1001
01:11:01,564 --> 01:11:03,603
He forgot all practice.

1002
01:11:03,603 --> 01:11:05,573
Let's go.

1003
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:10,395
Wait...

1004
01:11:12,325 --> 01:11:15,415
Let me tell you the book I read.

1005
01:11:15,415 --> 01:11:17,685
About microbiology.

1006
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:18,735
It's my favorite biology.

1007
01:11:27,564 --> 01:11:29,554
Hello little girl.

1008
01:11:29,554 --> 01:11:33,504
What are you doing here alone?

1009
01:11:37,984 --> 01:11:41,344
You're a lightning woman.

1010
01:11:52,365 --> 01:11:53,325
Dansaþi?

1011
01:12:21,386 --> 01:12:22,586
Whichever?

1012
01:12:25,366 --> 01:12:28,076
I hate this place.

1013
01:12:31,855 --> 01:12:34,365
Her ability is the dancing fight.

1014
01:12:34,365 --> 01:12:36,485
Alex, what do you think? What is the plan?

1015
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,585
- What the?
- Which one are we taking?

1016
01:12:38,585 --> 01:12:41,185
I do not know... I told you...

1017
01:12:41,185 --> 01:12:45,375
- We have to fly, do not we? Helicopter.
- I told you, I do not know.

1018
01:12:55,456 --> 01:12:57,426
It gives them cafes.

1019
01:12:57,426 --> 01:12:59,376
This is our girl.

1020
01:12:59,376 --> 01:12:59,996
Yeah, great!

1021
01:13:08,436 --> 01:13:11,566
Destroy them.

1022
01:13:46,606 --> 01:13:48,576
Bravo, face!

1023
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:55,348
Yes!

1024
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:59,387
You are my heroine.

1025
01:13:59,387 --> 01:14:00,867
We have to leave.

1026
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:03,387
Give me a hug, face.

1027
01:14:03,387 --> 01:14:04,397
- God.
- You did it!

1028
01:14:04,397 --> 01:14:06,457
- I did it!
- Yeah, give me a hug, face.

1029
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:10,457
We do not have time to dress here.

1030
01:14:10,457 --> 01:14:12,447
Come on motorcycles, let's wipe it out.

1031
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,457
Look, airplane, we have to fly, man.

1032
01:14:14,457 --> 01:14:17,477
No, I can not do that.

1033
01:14:17,477 --> 01:14:20,606
I told you I'm not a good pilot.

1034
01:14:20,606 --> 01:14:22,186
Maybe we should take the school bus?

1035
01:14:22,186 --> 01:14:24,576
What the? We can not cross the school bus.

1036
01:14:24,576 --> 01:14:27,418
You picked the plane and the balloon, maybe the helicopter.

1037
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:28,778
No, I can not do it. Good?

1038
01:14:28,778 --> 01:14:31,318
I do not want to die.

1039
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:33,448
I'm a little scared.

1040
01:14:33,448 --> 01:14:37,008
All right, I do it.

1041
01:14:37,008 --> 01:14:41,587
How difficult it is to fly the helicopter, push the button and spin the propeller.

1042
01:14:41,587 --> 01:14:44,397
After that...

1043
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,567
I pull the lever. So you go back and forth.

1044
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:50,337
Once we get into the air, we'll be fine.

1045
01:14:50,337 --> 01:14:54,437
I just have to climb, it does not have this scale, so ..

1046
01:14:54,437 --> 01:14:57,537
Let me see, you know what, I think I'm gonna get in.

1047
01:14:57,537 --> 01:14:59,449
- No, you're drunk.
- Not.

1048
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:02,579
Fridge, you are drunk. Give me the keys.

1049
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:06,318
And Alex. Alex... If I can fight these guys...

1050
01:15:06,318 --> 01:15:09,328
And you can fly the helicopter. I know you can do it.

1051
01:15:09,328 --> 01:15:11,418
Come on.

1052
01:15:12,568 --> 01:15:13,818
Alex.

1053
01:15:15,498 --> 01:15:17,748
It's time we need you.

1054
01:15:17,748 --> 01:15:21,438
Do not forget that you are the missing piece.

1055
01:15:24,248 --> 01:15:27,407
Waterman McDonough, on duty.

1056
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:28,127
Let's.

1057
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:01,678
What happened?

1058
01:16:01,678 --> 01:16:03,360
- Something has gone wrong!
- What the?

1059
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,410
Hold yourself well!

1060
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:17,329
God, we're gonna die! We'll die!

1061
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:24,599
Lord!

1062
01:16:24,599 --> 01:16:27,439
- He does not want to get up.
- What the? What do you want to say?

1063
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:29,409
- The blades are damaged.
- What the?

1064
01:16:29,409 --> 01:16:32,568
Someone has to go up there and tilt the rotor that fixes the propeller.

1065
01:16:32,568 --> 01:16:35,950
That's what we're getting up and down.

1066
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,300
Friends...

1067
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,320
That can not be good.

1068
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,350
They're not good news.

1069
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:57,399
White rhinoes!

1070
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:04,849
They are native animals from Jumanji, big, white, and eat people.

1071
01:17:04,849 --> 01:17:07,379
It's not possible!

1072
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:11,901
- To draw near.
- It took my stomach.

1073
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:14,420
- Up!
- I can not climb!

1074
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:17,960
I think I used too many margaritas.

1075
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,360
What are we going to do?

1076
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,450
I'll fix the helicopter.

1077
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:26,360
- Yes!
- Tell me what I have to do.

1078
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,460
You must connect the flight rod to the propeller rotor.

1079
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:32,630
- The rotor flight rod.
- Wait, what?

1080
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:34,370
I'll be right back.

1081
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,149
Spencer, where are you going?

1082
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:37,599
Grãbeºte up!

1083
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:40,409
- Take care!
- Grow up.

1084
01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:47,271
I'll stand on this, and I'm headed for the lethal plummet.

1085
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:49,621
Here's the flight rod.

1086
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,400
Spencer!

1087
01:18:14,412 --> 01:18:17,222
Spencer!

1088
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:19,741
Grãbeºte up!

1089
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:22,451
Come on, Spencer!

1090
01:18:28,461 --> 01:18:31,691
We do not have time.

1091
01:18:32,801 --> 01:18:33,221
Ready!

1092
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,370
What the? We did, I thought we were going to die.

1093
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,090
Goods!

1094
01:18:48,412 --> 01:18:50,382
What I was scared!

1095
01:18:50,382 --> 01:18:52,252
Oops.

1096
01:18:52,252 --> 01:18:53,582
What the?

1097
01:18:54,692 --> 01:18:56,462
It's gently washed away.

1098
01:18:56,462 --> 01:18:58,582
- What the?
- Did you get rid of the gem?

1099
01:18:58,582 --> 01:19:01,742
I leaned to believe that I was vomiting, but I did not.

1100
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:03,291
And the gem fell from my backpack.

1101
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:04,611
We need that gem!

1102
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:05,701
I know.

1103
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:08,361
That's the crazy part, because I know we need her.

1104
01:19:08,361 --> 01:19:10,361
Not. We are in difficulty.

1105
01:19:10,361 --> 01:19:12,681
Alex, come back, we have to go back and take it.

1106
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:13,871
Yes, take a detour.

1107
01:19:14,071 --> 01:19:18,371
Let's find her, open eyes, to work as a group.

1108
01:19:24,992 --> 01:19:27,422
There! I see her.

1109
01:19:34,362 --> 01:19:36,022
What I do?

1110
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:38,462
It seems to protect her.

1111
01:19:38,462 --> 01:19:39,592
Okay, how will we do that?

1112
01:19:39,592 --> 01:19:41,402
I do not know.

1113
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:44,402
You will take it, are not you, man?

1114
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:52,823
What do you need, boomerang, maybe scissors, iron pipes, laces ..

1115
01:19:52,823 --> 01:19:55,573
I'll help you, whatever you need, I can give you, okay?

1116
01:19:55,573 --> 01:19:58,353
You choose.

1117
01:19:58,353 --> 01:20:00,263
- What the?
- Sorry.

1118
01:20:00,263 --> 01:20:01,613
Sorry for what?

1119
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:13,842
It's not possible...

1120
01:20:26,144 --> 01:20:28,044
Turn us!

1121
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:34,173
Help!

1122
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,443
Dear good!

1123
01:20:36,743 --> 01:20:39,533
Alex, get ready to go back!

1124
01:20:39,533 --> 01:20:41,453
What the?

1125
01:20:41,453 --> 01:20:45,443
When I give you the signal, turn 90 degrees to the right.

1126
01:20:45,443 --> 01:20:46,443
Now!

1127
01:20:50,723 --> 01:20:54,622
You pushed me out of a helicopter, bitch!

1128
01:20:59,794 --> 01:21:04,064
- You're amazing, Spencer.
- You're an excellent pilot, Alex.

1129
01:21:04,064 --> 01:21:05,734
And Spencer, you are wonderful.

1130
01:21:05,734 --> 01:21:09,574
- Thanks, but he was...
- Not. You...

1131
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:11,574
you were wonderful.

1132
01:21:11,574 --> 01:21:15,643
Sorry Sorry. I'm the one who sacrificed.

1133
01:21:15,643 --> 01:21:18,743
You do not know what it's like to be inside a rhinoceros.

1134
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:21,963
And you do not even want to know.

1135
01:21:21,963 --> 01:21:25,943
I've seen many things. I felt it too.

1136
01:21:25,943 --> 01:21:30,323
Things that can never be deleted from my memory.

1137
01:21:30,323 --> 01:21:34,595
It's funny for you. Râdeþi. Come on.

1138
01:21:35,675 --> 01:21:39,574
I've been trying to cross the canyon for 20 years.

1139
01:21:39,574 --> 01:21:42,604
Do you realize how big it is?

1140
01:21:46,934 --> 01:21:48,604
- Thonar.
- Not!

1141
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:49,754
Not...

1142
01:21:49,754 --> 01:21:51,614
Alex, no...

1143
01:21:51,614 --> 01:21:53,584
- Alex. Not.
- Alex.

1144
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:56,614
Alex, look at me.

1145
01:21:56,614 --> 01:21:57,623
She's dying.

1146
01:21:57,623 --> 01:21:59,683
We can not let him die. We are very close.

1147
01:21:59,683 --> 01:22:01,593
Does anyone know how to resuscitate?

1148
01:22:01,593 --> 01:22:04,755
Yes, start by pressing your chest 3 times and breathing mouth to mouth.

1149
01:22:04,755 --> 01:22:06,735
One two Three.

1150
01:22:06,735 --> 01:22:08,005
How do you do this?

1151
01:22:08,005 --> 01:22:10,675
Tighten his nose and open his mouth.

1152
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:15,445
A breath, two breaths and repeats.

1153
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:25,604
Come on Alex.

1154
01:22:27,674 --> 01:22:31,274
Bethany, stop it. Your tattoo!

1155
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:34,634
Looks like you've given a life.

1156
01:22:35,694 --> 01:22:38,066
It's fine.

1157
01:22:38,066 --> 01:22:38,716
And if you need her?

1158
01:22:38,716 --> 01:22:41,725
I want Alex to go home.

1159
01:23:03,694 --> 01:23:04,694
What happened?

1160
01:23:04,694 --> 01:23:09,386
Alex, Bethany has given you her life.

1161
01:23:09,386 --> 01:23:09,626
Bethany, are you all right?

1162
01:23:09,626 --> 01:23:10,726
I think so.

1163
01:23:10,726 --> 01:23:12,636
Bethany, is that true?

1164
01:23:12,636 --> 01:23:14,636
Did you give me a life of yours?

1165
01:23:14,636 --> 01:23:17,816
Yes of course.

1166
01:23:17,816 --> 01:23:18,346
Thanks.

1167
01:23:28,615 --> 01:23:29,615
What are you looking at?

1168
01:23:29,615 --> 01:23:33,305
You have a problem.

1169
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:37,685
God, what a crazy thing these things are!

1170
01:23:51,746 --> 01:23:52,826
20 years?

1171
01:23:54,746 --> 01:23:57,646
Yes. I think so.

1172
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:06,296
I still think of my poor parents.

1173
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,006
By what I think they passed.

1174
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,865
And why, because I hid in my hiding place,

1175
01:24:09,865 --> 01:24:13,465
Being too afraid to finish the game.

1176
01:24:15,697 --> 01:24:16,417
Sorry.

1177
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:20,597
I do not want to tell you that, just...

1178
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,467
I'm easy to talk to you.

1179
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,407
I understand.

1180
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:26,737
Sometimes it's easy to focus on yours,

1181
01:24:26,737 --> 01:24:32,636
that you think other people also have problems.

1182
01:24:33,606 --> 01:24:34,746
You said something very deeply.

1183
01:24:34,746 --> 01:24:37,076
Thanks. I feel that since I lost my cellphone,

1184
01:24:37,076 --> 01:24:41,456
My other senses have sharpened.

1185
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:46,376
Does the phone mean something different in the future?

1186
01:24:50,098 --> 01:24:51,778
But you, Alex, what do you like?

1187
01:24:51,778 --> 01:24:55,037
In the real world.

1188
01:24:56,157 --> 01:25:01,437
I have a rock band. I'm a drummer like my dad.

1189
01:25:14,596 --> 01:25:15,596
Hey.

1190
01:25:17,726 --> 01:25:20,018
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1191
01:25:20,018 --> 01:25:21,728
We're filling these up.

1192
01:25:21,728 --> 01:25:24,638
- Misto.
- Yes.

1193
01:25:28,818 --> 01:25:30,698
I'm glad you're here, I ..

1194
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:34,168
I want to tell you something.

1195
01:25:34,168 --> 01:25:34,748
Yes?

1196
01:25:34,748 --> 01:25:40,447
And I want to tell you now. If we talk again next time...

1197
01:25:40,447 --> 01:25:42,677
I have no courage.

1198
01:25:44,647 --> 01:25:46,587
I like you, Martha.

1199
01:25:46,587 --> 01:25:47,437
I like you crazy.

1200
01:25:50,697 --> 01:25:53,689
I'm crazy about you.

1201
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:57,069
- Yes? Absolutely.

1202
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:57,578
In the seventh grade.

1203
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:03,218
Really?

1204
01:26:04,578 --> 01:26:08,878
It has not happened to me.

1205
01:26:08,878 --> 01:26:10,048
What do you want to say?

1206
01:26:10,048 --> 01:26:13,678
I mean, nobody likes me, I can not believe I did that.

1207
01:26:13,678 --> 01:26:17,588
I never told anyone about my feelings.

1208
01:26:18,728 --> 01:26:21,697
And I like you, Spencer.

1209
01:26:22,657 --> 01:26:23,657
- Really?
- Yes.

1210
01:26:23,657 --> 01:26:28,729
Yes! You are smart, kind and sweet.

1211
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:33,089
Yes. And I like you.

1212
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:38,669
Wait. Are you sure it's not all this?

1213
01:26:38,669 --> 01:26:42,518
What the? God, no. You're not my kind.

1214
01:26:42,518 --> 01:26:43,608
I like nerds.

1215
01:26:43,608 --> 01:26:45,318
Really? I'm a nerd!

1216
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:10,739
I never kissed anyone.

1217
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:14,159
- That's the first time.
- And to me the same.

1218
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,539
Good. Goods.

1219
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:17,579
Do not say, okay?

1220
01:27:20,609 --> 01:27:22,519
Come on!

1221
01:27:22,519 --> 01:27:26,228
I do not want to see that. I do not want, not today.

1222
01:27:26,228 --> 01:27:29,648
You taught your love and I found the jaguar.

1223
01:27:29,648 --> 01:27:30,760
Come on.

1224
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,010
Lord.

1225
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:44,640
Here it.

1226
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,579
Here it.

1227
01:27:46,579 --> 01:27:48,739
We'd better go.

1228
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:13,760
I think we need to follow this path.

1229
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:14,770
Not.

1230
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,420
It can not be that easy.

1231
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,640
"Defenders."

1232
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:23,710
What does it mean?

1233
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:28,170
There's only one way to find out.

1234
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,649
Fridge, give me jewelery.

1235
01:28:34,599 --> 01:28:36,281
Spencer.

1236
01:28:51,751 --> 01:28:53,680
Something's going to happen.

1237
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,710
I hate these drums.

1238
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:58,650
Hey, you can not just go there.

1239
01:28:58,650 --> 01:28:59,650
Not.

1240
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,650
That's what the game wants us to do.

1241
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:05,970
Let's follow the path.

1242
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:07,720
It's a trap.

1243
01:29:13,742 --> 01:29:19,701
When you see the elephant you start climbing.

1244
01:29:23,741 --> 01:29:25,801
I take it through the trees.

1245
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:26,711
- Trees?
- Yes.

1246
01:29:26,711 --> 01:29:30,201
- Do you think that means?
- Definitely.

1247
01:29:30,201 --> 01:29:31,581
That's right.

1248
01:29:31,581 --> 01:29:34,591
It's the last level of the game.

1249
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:38,450
And I'm almost sure it's a Bravestone thing.

1250
01:29:42,692 --> 01:29:44,692
Did he talk to him in the third person?

1251
01:29:44,692 --> 01:29:45,592
I think at fourth.

1252
01:29:53,612 --> 01:29:57,152
How does that work?

1253
01:29:57,152 --> 01:29:58,641
Picking up is one of his abilities.

1254
01:29:58,641 --> 01:30:00,741
I understand.

1255
01:30:00,741 --> 01:30:03,751
Cake makes me explode.

1256
01:30:24,672 --> 01:30:27,452
- Not!
- God!

1257
01:30:27,452 --> 01:30:28,052
Spencer!

1258
01:30:37,652 --> 01:30:39,642
God, there are panthers.

1259
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:40,642
Not.

1260
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:47,723
They're jaguars.

1261
01:31:07,752 --> 01:31:08,712
Spencer!

1262
01:31:10,572 --> 01:31:11,712
God, are you all right?

1263
01:31:11,712 --> 01:31:13,692
I think so.

1264
01:31:13,692 --> 01:31:16,592
You got another gem, right?

1265
01:31:16,592 --> 01:31:18,452
- Yes.
- Thank God.

1266
01:31:18,452 --> 01:31:19,894
What happened?

1267
01:31:19,894 --> 01:31:21,654
I do not want to talk about this.

1268
01:31:22,694 --> 01:31:23,664
We need a new plan.

1269
01:31:23,664 --> 01:31:24,663
- Right.
- Yes.

1270
01:31:24,663 --> 01:31:29,063
- Total.
- Spencer, do you have any ideas?

1271
01:31:30,433 --> 01:31:32,633
Can I talk to you for a moment?

1272
01:31:32,633 --> 01:31:33,633
Now?

1273
01:31:36,643 --> 01:31:38,703
What happened?

1274
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:40,713
I cant do this.

1275
01:31:40,713 --> 01:31:44,683
- What are you talking about?
- I cant do this.

1276
01:31:44,683 --> 01:31:48,252
Who are they hunting? I'm not an adventurer.

1277
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:50,632
- Actually, I'm not brave.
- Spencer...

1278
01:31:50,632 --> 01:31:52,884
I saw you hanging on a helicopter.

1279
01:31:52,884 --> 01:31:55,654
It's easy to be brave when you have spare lives.

1280
01:31:55,654 --> 01:32:00,764
Much harder if you only have one life.

1281
01:32:01,644 --> 01:32:06,444
We all have one life, man.

1282
01:32:06,444 --> 01:32:10,613
That's all we get. That's how it works.

1283
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:13,513
The question is how do we live it.

1284
01:32:13,513 --> 01:32:17,443
What kind of man you want to be.

1285
01:32:18,593 --> 01:32:21,183
Did we quote our director somehow?

1286
01:32:21,183 --> 01:32:22,833
God, this game is a danger, I gotta get out of here.

1287
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:26,755
Look, we can do that, man.

1288
01:32:27,635 --> 01:32:30,684
We can do it together.

1289
01:32:32,674 --> 01:32:33,754
Together.

1290
01:32:37,714 --> 01:32:40,614
You're a good friend, Fridge.

1291
01:32:44,174 --> 01:32:46,084
Good.

1292
01:32:46,084 --> 01:32:46,854
Good.

1293
01:32:46,854 --> 01:32:49,184
I'm not good at video games.

1294
01:32:49,184 --> 01:32:50,684
But I'm good at football.

1295
01:32:50,684 --> 01:32:53,623
That line out there...

1296
01:32:53,623 --> 01:32:54,713
are defensors.

1297
01:32:54,713 --> 01:32:57,925
Which means we have to go through it.

1298
01:32:57,925 --> 01:32:59,895
Friends...

1299
01:33:01,605 --> 01:33:02,685
We have to leave.

1300
01:33:02,685 --> 01:33:05,665
Well, look how we do.

1301
01:33:07,745 --> 01:33:09,735
We will play what I call:

1302
01:33:09,735 --> 01:33:12,605
"Double chance of winning."

1303
01:33:12,605 --> 01:33:15,804
Bethany, you take it to the left.

1304
01:33:15,804 --> 01:33:17,504
I take it to the right.

1305
01:33:17,504 --> 01:33:20,474
Alex, you'll take it in the middle.

1306
01:33:20,474 --> 01:33:21,684
I'm going with Spencer.

1307
01:33:21,684 --> 01:33:24,614
No, you have to do something else.

1308
01:33:35,665 --> 01:33:36,625
Dansaþi?

1309
01:33:53,755 --> 01:33:54,955
Hey! Here!

1310
01:33:56,905 --> 01:33:58,614
Come and catch me!

1311
01:34:35,727 --> 01:34:38,697
- Thank you.
- With pleasure.

1312
01:34:41,346 --> 01:34:43,466
Go to the statue. Go!

1313
01:36:13,938 --> 01:36:15,618
Oh man,okay.

1314
01:36:15,618 --> 01:36:18,648
Stay calm and do not panic.

1315
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:20,468
Turns out!

1316
01:36:24,638 --> 01:36:27,718
He's an elephant and a sling.

1317
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:32,427
How are you? I'm Finbar Mouse.

1318
01:36:32,427 --> 01:36:32,927
Zoologist and the rucsac '.

1319
01:36:57,638 --> 01:36:58,768
Give me the jewel

1320
01:36:58,768 --> 01:37:01,748
or your boyfriend dies.

1321
01:37:03,098 --> 01:37:04,668
- Do not give it.
- Remain silent!

1322
01:37:04,668 --> 01:37:06,668
Turns out!

1323
01:37:10,788 --> 01:37:14,487
Take me in return, okay?

1324
01:37:22,669 --> 01:37:24,759
Give me the jewel.

1325
01:37:24,759 --> 01:37:26,699
I cant do this.

1326
01:37:26,699 --> 01:37:27,699
5...

1327
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:30,639
- 4...
- I can not give you the gem.

1328
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:31,769
3...

1329
01:37:31,769 --> 01:37:32,909
- Spencer.
- 2...

1330
01:37:32,909 --> 01:37:34,739
Because I do not have it.

1331
01:37:42,718 --> 01:37:47,168
The zoologist is coming, jerk!

1332
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:56,500
No no!

1333
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:12,639
Elephant.

1334
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:14,709
Start climbing.

1335
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,588
Go there and I'll bring you the gem.

1336
01:38:20,588 --> 01:38:22,678
- Martha.
- Believe me I'll get it.

1337
01:38:22,678 --> 01:38:23,428
Go!

1338
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:33,980
Go, Martha!

1339
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:42,979
Alex!

1340
01:39:41,711 --> 01:39:44,611
I get the gem.

1341
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:58,590
The game is over.

1342
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,631
I do not believe this.

1343
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:17,611
Venom is my weakness.

1344
01:40:45,742 --> 01:40:48,672
Go, Spencer!

1345
01:40:58,451 --> 01:40:59,451
Not.

1346
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:10,793
That's great!

1347
01:41:10,793 --> 01:41:12,663
Good!

1348
01:41:24,742 --> 01:41:28,072
Gimme his name!

1349
01:41:28,072 --> 01:41:29,442
Everybody call his name!

1350
01:41:29,442 --> 01:41:30,402
Jumanji!

1351
01:42:15,564 --> 01:42:17,274
- I think I did.
- I think we've won.

1352
01:42:17,274 --> 01:42:19,463
I think we have succeeded.

1353
01:42:19,463 --> 01:42:21,513
Friends, Nigel comes.

1354
01:42:21,513 --> 01:42:22,213
Nigel.

1355
01:42:31,483 --> 01:42:33,643
Bravo, adventurers.

1356
01:42:33,643 --> 01:42:34,703
You lifted the curse.

1357
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:36,703
Everyone in Jumanji thanks you.

1358
01:42:36,703 --> 01:42:39,423
You've done the job here.

1359
01:42:39,423 --> 01:42:42,382
Unfortunately, here we are going to separate.

1360
01:42:42,382 --> 01:42:42,742
Seaplane McDonough.

1361
01:42:42,742 --> 01:42:45,722
Let me shake my hand.

1362
01:42:51,764 --> 01:42:52,604
Alex...

1363
01:42:58,994 --> 01:43:01,914
And you, Professor Oberon.

1364
01:43:07,403 --> 01:43:08,603
Later, friends.

1365
01:43:14,683 --> 01:43:18,623
- I will miss you...
- Get me out of here!

1366
01:43:25,704 --> 01:43:28,694
Goodbye, Ruby Roundhouse.

1367
01:43:29,634 --> 01:43:30,634
Wait.

1368
01:43:30,634 --> 01:43:33,984
If we do not come back?

1369
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:34,854
I just...

1370
01:43:36,744 --> 01:43:40,024
I like to be so.

1371
01:43:40,024 --> 01:43:41,644
With you.

1372
01:43:41,644 --> 01:43:44,744
Well, then... let's be that.

1373
01:43:44,744 --> 01:43:45,464
Daily.

1374
01:43:49,163 --> 01:43:50,683
Come home.

1375
01:44:07,705 --> 01:44:10,614
Doctor Bravestone...

1376
01:44:22,154 --> 01:44:23,494
Nigel...

1377
01:44:23,494 --> 01:44:25,656
I'm ready to go home.

1378
01:44:25,656 --> 01:44:29,206
Pa, my dear friend.

1379
01:44:32,665 --> 01:44:35,935
Pa, Bravestone.

1380
01:45:06,266 --> 01:45:08,596
- God...
- Allright then...

1381
01:45:08,596 --> 01:45:09,606
I'm back, baby!

1382
01:45:09,606 --> 01:45:13,655
I have no longer complained of how it looks.

1383
01:45:13,655 --> 01:45:15,665
I missed you.

1384
01:45:20,715 --> 01:45:24,415
Where is Alex?

1385
01:45:44,636 --> 01:45:46,766
Hey, look...

1386
01:45:50,716 --> 01:45:53,306
The weird house?

1387
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:56,806
Do you think that...

1388
01:45:56,806 --> 01:46:01,455
That means he can...

1389
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:27,366
- Alex?
- Hey, Dad, can you come here to help me?

1390
01:46:27,366 --> 01:46:28,366
Yes.

1391
01:46:37,658 --> 01:46:39,838
Father, excuse me for a moment?

1392
01:46:39,838 --> 01:46:41,727
- Sure.
- Be right back.

1393
01:46:56,477 --> 01:46:58,627
Bethany?

1394
01:46:59,687 --> 01:47:00,737
Spencer?

1395
01:47:00,737 --> 01:47:01,737
Yes.

1396
01:47:03,776 --> 01:47:05,676
Ruby Roundhouse?

1397
01:47:08,598 --> 01:47:11,848
And you're a Fridge.

1398
01:47:14,598 --> 01:47:18,628
I'm surprised to see you all.

1399
01:47:19,608 --> 01:47:21,708
- You came back.
- Yes.

1400
01:47:21,708 --> 01:47:25,637
He took me from where I left...

1401
01:47:26,957 --> 01:47:28,437
In 1996.

1402
01:47:28,437 --> 01:47:31,237
And your parents and your house?

1403
01:47:31,467 --> 01:47:34,627
Yeah, it's all good, pal.

1404
01:47:37,967 --> 01:47:39,597
Now you're an adult.

1405
01:47:39,597 --> 01:47:41,999
Do you have a child.

1406
01:47:41,999 --> 01:47:43,449
Yes, that's right.

1407
01:47:43,449 --> 01:47:44,639
He's Andy.

1408
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:51,438
And my daughter's called Bethany.

1409
01:47:52,488 --> 01:47:56,398
I gave her the name of the girl who saved my life.

1410
01:48:01,598 --> 01:48:04,428
I'm so surprised.

1411
01:48:24,249 --> 01:48:24,969
Salve.

1412
01:48:27,959 --> 01:48:33,018
Do you want to go on trips? Namely in nature?

1413
01:48:33,898 --> 01:48:38,828
Yes. Something amazing next summer. What do you think?

1414
01:48:39,638 --> 01:48:40,728
Are you all right?

1415
01:48:40,728 --> 01:48:41,928
Hey!

1416
01:48:42,888 --> 01:48:45,918
I'll see you after hours.

1417
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:49,570
- Hi.
- Howdy.

1418
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:55,699
- Has something interesting happened?
- No, nothing comes to mind.

1419
01:48:57,259 --> 01:48:59,999
- Did you even talk to Martha?
- I gave him a message on the weekend.

1420
01:49:01,609 --> 01:49:05,299
Did not you talk to her again?

1421
01:49:05,299 --> 01:49:06,499
There she is.

1422
01:49:11,689 --> 01:49:13,778
Go to the door, Doctor Bravestone.

1423
01:49:23,370 --> 01:49:24,760
- Hello.
- Hi.

1424
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:27,890
- I really wanted to call you.
- I understand you.

1425
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:30,100
- Sorry. I do not know why...
- A strange thing...

1426
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:33,660
As if you did not know. I wondered what was happening.

1427
01:49:37,489 --> 01:49:38,999
What?

1428
01:49:52,501 --> 01:49:55,091
Impressive.

1429
